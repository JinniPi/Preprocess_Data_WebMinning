They say they utilize a 3rd party called ThroughTek (offices in china and japan - none in US) to handle the transfer of videos. Wyze Cam claims the content is sent securely to aws. Examining the network traffic from camera shows that content is routed thru many providers including AWS, Linode (US) Vultr/Choopa (europe) and Aliyum/Alibaba (china). They seem to also utilize NTP server in Russia. To get more details.. search on web for \"WyzeCam sending data to servers other than AWS\" and you will find a Reddit article.

{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Excellent camera, but software lets it down...", "review_body": "The hardware is pretty dang good for the price. 1920x1080 good \"security camera\" quality picture and decent infrared LED illumination for night. Decent mounting system although not very flexible pan or tilt when mounting on a wall, works best either upside down or just sitting on a flat surface. Power cord is just about 2 meters, so not really long enough for most mounting applications but fine if you are setting it on a shelf or something. This is a cool concept, but the software is where it lets you down... hard."},

We have a half dozen webcams scattered around the house, both inside and outside, that we use for security monitoring when we are away.  Over the years I've installed cameras from Linksys, Foscam, Insteon and Wansview (NOTE: Foscam, Insteon and Wansview are, for all intents and purposes, the same camera).  All of them have gotten the job done, and have cost anywhere from $50-$100 dollars.  But after trying out this little camera, I'll never buy anything else again.  At least not for indoor use."},

I loved them, until today when I learned that they record Sound & Motion when they are TURNED OFF.  I would turn them ON whenever I left my apartment and turned them OFF when I came home.  Today I discovered, quite by accident, that the 2 cameras were recording ALL DAY LONG!  One captured a cell phone conversation and another captured me completely naked when I was changing clothes.  While the sound & motion was going on I received NO alerts of this activity.  This hasn't happened before.  I am horrified!  Now I am being spied on in my own home.  I now have both cameras unplugged & facing down.  I can't tell you what is wrong.  I do not recommend buying this camera."},

I have this camera mounted outside, I purchased the little \"house\" available here on Amazon, and so far so good!  I have a great view of my driveway!  I already have two other WYZE cameras outside, one protecting my front door and one protecting the back door, and they work great during the day or night.  I have had those outside since Frb and they have survived cold, snow, and rain. I don't use the alerts, so I can't comment on them.  I record directly to SD cards.  The picture is clear and the app is useful.  I also have three Amazon Cloud Cameras too, which I also love, however I have to say, these WYZE cameras have more features, recording to an SD card for one, then the Cloud cameras have.  Plus these WYZE cameras are a quarter of the price!  I have one camera pointing outside through my living room window.  I have to turn off the night vision due to reflection, however i get a great view!  I wish I could think of more places I need to monitor, I would buy more WYZE cameras!"},

I have an older model apple tv and I wanted an additional streaming device for my bedroom TV. I got a relative the firestick and tried it out myself - didn't really love the interface so ultimately decided to give the Roku Express a shot. Initially I thought I was \"downgrading\" by getting the Roku Express since it's so much cheaper than an Apple TV. So not a downgrade!! This device is lightning fast. I like it so much better that I use it as my main device now and moved the other one to my bedroom. I didn't realize how fast a streaming player was capable of being till now. There are some other things I noticed compared to my other device. I'll break down the pros and cons into a list."},

I didn't have any special channels...no HBO, SHOtime....anything. Not even top tier cable. I had the middle package and it cost me an arm and a leg. I decided to cancel my cable long before I even bought the Roku. I only bought it when the Superbowl rolled around and I needed to make sure I could watch it. This thing is amazing. You pay the $30 for the device and THAT'S IT. No subscription fees, no hidden taxes, nothing! You can chose to add hulu, netflix or HBO if you wanted to pay a subscription through them, or do what I do and just use my sisters. :) It has turned my old TV into a smart TV. Best purchase ever.

I tried everything, new modem, new router, clearing cache, etc. etc.  You probably know what I'm talking about.  I was considering upgrading the disc player, but wasn't really keen on spending the money when the disc player I have works fine for discs.  I finally decided to go this route.  Awesome!! Roku plays it all, and for only $30 bucks, I have zero reason to complain, since I'm now have zero technical problems with streaming content.  Yay!!!  I should add here that my older-model CRT-type HD TV only has a single HDMI input, so the Roku is hooked up to an HDMI 3-way spllitter. This allows me ro run the Roku box, my disc player, and occasionally hook my camera up without having to plug and unplug cables.  I use a wireless router to get the broadband signal from modem to Roku box."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Works Great but it has Heat Issues", "review_body": "I bought this streaming device based on using this identical model in a hotel I stayed in earlier this year.  The simplicity and good performance were the major factors that influenced my decision to go with it.  Full disclosure; I have cable internet at 70+ Mbps at home so slower data speeds could significantly reduce the performance.  In my case, 3+ hour movies on Netflix or Amazon will load and start to play within 8-10 seconds max.  I can also fast forward and rewind with incredible speed; nearly no buffering.  Setup and use is very easy.  Things have come a long way from the first Roku streaming device that came about about 10 years ago.  I purchased the original model back then and ran it on DSL based internet; it was an amazing device for the time; it looked like DVD quality on a CRT screen.

Just use a flat-head screw, instead of the countersink, or V-shaped, screw heads.  As another tip, put a piece of painters tape (or masking tape) on the back side of the power strip.  You will be able to see the mounting holes through the tape.  Poke a small hole through the tape at the very top of the mounting hole (to ensure both holes are at the same level in the mounting hole).  Then just peel the tape and apply it to where you are mounting the power strip and drill through the holes in the tape - perfectly aligned mounting holes."},

I just assumed the recording length would be as long as movement is detected. This is not the case. you will get one 12-14 second recording and then it will take significant amount of time for it to record another 12 - 14 second clip (3-5 minutes). My point being is if you're using this as a a security camera it's absolutely pointless. You may catch a person entering your domain but you won't get much more than that due to the time allotted. I would even venture to say that you probably won't get a good look at the perp until long after the 12 seconds they give you. Forget about seeing what the perp took. Having a micro SD card is pointless as well because if it's seen or recognized there is nothing stopping the thief from taking your cam (with micro sd inserted) and rolling out with it. This was a good effort but fails on nearly every security front. On a side note I was not expecting amazing quality of the footage considering the price and they pretty much delivered what was expected (bad quality picture over gigabit speeds).

It was easy to install and didn't take much time to set up (though I recommend starting subscriptions to services like Sling or Netflix from a computer to make things go faster since typing letter by letter on the on-screen interface is tedious for more than entering a user name and password). I liked my Roku so much that I purchased a second one to use on my old, non-digital tv. That works well and I can begin watching a program on one television, stop when I want to, then start up again where I left off on either tv. Oh, and the Roku \"box\" is about the size of a pack of chewing gum - a big saving of space over the box required by the cable company (and no monthly fee for the Roku device, just the one time purchase price). As for savings, I now spend a little over half each month for Internet, Sling and other channel subscriptions as I spent for cable tv and Internet through the cable company."},

Added bonus of expanded channel tier beyond the basic tier you pay for which the Spectrum box limits (not to mention all the other apps like Netflix) so you can watch ALL the spectrum channels you pay for.

I am a semi-pro photographer and normally shoot pics with a Cannon Mark IV so I prefer the high definition a 35mm camera offers.

There is quite a selection of clock faces, and you can control what is displays with one glaring and VERY ANNOYING exception.  You can't turn off the \"Things to try\" screen You can turn off the screen scroll, but that defeats the purpose of having the screen.  I don't need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things I can do with Alexa.  I don't need the advertising, especially at the cost of this device. Just a couple of more things to add.  The stand (That little .50 bit of plastic they sell for $20) dosn't come with the unit. Why??? Let the purchaser decide if they want to use it or not.  Lastly there absolutely should be a Physical way to override the camera on ANY product that comes with one. They promote this as an in home/bedroom appliance, you should be able, with absolute conference, be able to know the camera can not see anything.  Yes you can disable the camera in the software, but that can be remotely overridden.  Overall, its an expensive Alexa device with a screen that's not very useful and annoying.

I don't think that there is a flaw in this packet. but the first time that I opened it I got a little confused because the film is not individually in the box they are in a little black box. And the instructions is on the wrapper that the film is in and I ripped it so I couldn't figure out how to insert it at first but the Fuji film company was smart and they put the instructions on the black box so they were prepared.

I purchased it so that I could attach it to the wall at desk level so that I could plug in my computer equipment without having to crawl underneath the desk. The electrical cord is too short to reach the top of the desk which makes it unusable for the purpose I was intending it to be used for. If the holes that allows you to attach it to the wall was designed so that it could be pointing upward or downward it would be acceptable. Not only were the holes upside down but they would not accept any kind of screw only a certain type of nail that was not included. It seems that this outlet was not very well engineered. If you are going to attach this surge protector to the wall higher than the plug-in, I would not recommend this for you to purchased. Amazon did not show the backside of the surge protectors.

Strangely enough, though, it's a miserable, terrible clock.  My cheap old clock radio has bright 7/8\" (digital) numbers.  I can see it day or night from anywhere in the room.  The echo spot has half-size digits, 7/16\" but only when it feels like showing them.  It goes to sleep at night, so if you're half asleep you're out of luck.  You can wake yourself up, and move close  enough to see the tiny dimmed numbers, or you could call out and ask it, and wake everyone else, or you can just go back to sleep and quit worrying about the time.  And as often as not, it changes those tiny 7/16\" digits to much smaller ones to show you the temperature.  I know I could go into settings and make that stop but my old clock radio never sacrificed the time to make me look at the temperature.  To add insult to injury, they advertise the echo spot as having all these different clock faces.  What a lousy scam!  You have these tiny digital numbers, and you can change them to 5 other tiny digital numbers that are exactly the same.  The screen is large enough that they could make it a fine clock, I don't understand why they don't?"},

I have a few things I want to point out and compare. I own two Canary Home security cameras and I can say the Wyze Cam overall is a phenomenal value, it\u2019s got pretty much all the features of the Canary but at fractions of the price, so here\u2019s a few things it\u2019s currently missing; For starters the video capture for motion alerts is about 12 seconds long which isn\u2019t a deal breaker but I\u2019ve heard they may improve on this in the future, it only supports 2.4 GHZ Wi-Fi (for me this isn\u2019t an issue since my WiFi is pretty fast and I don\u2019t have any connection issues, You have to (at this time) manually activate and deactivate the motion alerts as there\u2019s no geofencing so the camera doesn\u2019t know when you\u2019ve left the house, there is also about a 30 second delay when motion is detected tans the motion is recorded but this may vary from time to time, video is capped at 10 frames a second put still looks quite smooth for a cheap camera like this one, and lastly the speaker isn\u2019t that great, so it may seem like there are many negatives but these are all very minor issues that can be fixed and enhanced for the future. For what your getting which is; 14 day video recording, varied notifications, 1080p video, night vision, SD, card reader and overall flexibility this camera is a steal and worth every penny.

My computer, my phone, my tablet, and my printer are all connected to internet as well as the Roku in our living room, another computer, and two other phones and we never have an issue with connectivity. But the Express on the 2nd floor cannot pick up a single -- it won't even detect the multiple networks half of the time.

We prefer Roku because it seems to be more convenient for us. The wireless connectivity is just as good, if not better, than the firestick. If you have roku tvs and like the interface, the roku express has the exact same interface and screensavers which is awesome.

Roku also offers an easy way to actually search and download \"channels\", which would be apps on Android TV media players. However, this is also it's biggest drawback. While you are actually able to download 3rd party apps on both Android and the Fire Stick, Roku will only allow the installation of Channels (apps), that are approved by them.

Beautiful packaging and the gorgeous Spot unit felt substantial in my eager hands. Its design and workmanship are truly first rate--especially at this price. It does all the usual Echo stuff but the beautiful touch screen takes it to another level altogether. You can also swipe through several screens where there are other views and options available such as a screen showing what is music playing complete with touch volume and track controls. The result is that you can do a lot less yelling at Alexa to do things for you or fooling around with the cranky Alexa app. It replaced a misbehaving Dot Gen 1 and an old clock radio, and it looks beautiful in the bedroom. Setup is done from the touch screen so you can say CYA to the Alexa app. I use it primarily for music and have it hooked up to two rescued/reborn mini Jambox speakers paired in stereo mode. Thanks to Amazon Music with its advanced fidelity technology (it replaces your uploads with high fidelity tracks) it sounds fantastic at the low volumes required for adult bedroom use. I tried the built-in speaker for a few minutes and it sounds much better than the Dot and closer to the Echo 2, albeit with lower volume potential. In fact, it sounds good enough all on its own and just may be sufficient for quiet spots like a bedroom, but external speakers really seal the deal. Finally, the Spot with touch screen and camera does a whole lot of new stuff that I probably will not use and note that I turned off the camera because it is creepy in a bedroom setting (it is easily turned back on using the settings touch screen should you want to use it for video calls, etc.) In summary, I could not be happier with this supremely-designed and constructed unit."},

You will have to sign up for the app with an email address and choose a complex password (Caps and lower case, number AND symbol.)  So if you want alerts in real time, use an email address that you get alerts from on your phone. Other than that the entire setup probably took less than a minute.

Lastly, I did see someone say there is no way to change the sensitivity, which is incorrect. You can set it to be sensitive from 1% to 100%.

So I just need to say, \"Alexa, show me the front door\", and I can see it on the little screen. I use it to play music a lot. The Amazon music service is great, especially as it usually shows lyrics too. But I often also use Pandora. So I say something like \"Alexa, play alternative 80s on Pandora\", and she does!

Let me tell you--I have professional grade security cameras that were installed on the exterior of my home, and we paid a lot of money to have that done, so I do know about expectations. These adorable little cameras that almost beg to be named were purchased for fun, because we already have cameras. We placed 1 on a shelf overlooking our foyer and front doors and the other 1 on our screened-in patio. Set-up was a breeze and the quality of picture was surprisingly good. The 2-way audio is a bonus. One day while visiting family I decided to open the app and talk to my cat who was visible on the camera. Suddenly I heard my husband, who was at work, asking if I was already home. He had opened the app and while viewing live he heard me calling our cat. Our family likes technology, so we're already familiar with the convenience of Google Home, and Amazon Echo; we use both in our home. But these cameras offer a lot for an astonishingly low price, and we found that though we bought these for fun, we have come to appreciate the extra layer of security they provide to our home. The app for viewing livestream and recordings works great. FYI we added the 32 GB MicroSD card for added memory."},

The downsides are (a) Roku does not return to the last app you were using so you have to re-open Spectrum each time we turn on the TV) and (b) none of the Roku's I've seen have channel number buttons so that you can go directly to a channel rather than scrolling (even when you've set up 20 favorites, it is somewhat cumbersome).

I also find that it hears me better than the Dot. Since this is being used as an alarm clock, this is where the advantage over the Dot comes in to play. On the Dot, you can either search for the button to hush Alexa, or scream to Alexa to shut up because she doesn't hear well over the alarm.  The Echo Spot allows to you simply tap the screen anywhere for snooze. You can't miss.  You can also swipe up from the bottom to cancel the alarm. I also like \"Show me the alarms\" and I get a visual display on the screen of the pending alarms.  Play some music and the screen shows me the album art and lyrics of the song playing.  Ask Alexa \"Where's my stuff\" and I see photos of my items displayed as it reads me the status. The device feels very solid, well made.  I will say it didn't seem right to have to pay an additional $20 for the base that really should be in the box. The base definitely completes the package though and allows it to swivel.  I would suggest if you are looking at an Echo device for the bedroom, the Spot won't disappoint."},

However,  I would have ultimately ended up with both as the Echo has a much better speaker.  Not that the one on the spot isnt good too, just better for a bedroom, while you can use the echo to provide music for a small (15 to 20 people) party. Also,  I am very sensitive to light and this digital clock Is perfectly dim during sleeping hours, which are customizable."},

I pre-ordered the Spot and received it the first week it was available.  After a months use now, I have to give it a big thumbs up!  I set it up on a nightstand in my bedroom and it replace my original Echo that I'd had there since it first came out.  I got a white one and that was a good decision for our decor but I got some immediate negative feedback from my technophobe wife.  She liked the way it looked but it did not put out the quality music we had received from the original Echo.  I knew this would be the case but had plans to add small stereo bluetooth speakers (one on each nightstand) to improve the sound beyond even that of the original Echo.  My wife was resistant to having a speaker on her nightstand but now seems to have accepted them as the trade-off for the much improved music we get from the Spot.  I am expecting Amazon to add to the visual capabilities over the year ahead, although it comes already with a variety of interesting and useful image options.  Next project is to add some smart features around the house!"},

It started with the original, then came the Tap, followed by the Show. Each of them fits into a different portion of our home. The original is in our bedroom and provides the news as we dress as well as music at other times. The Tap resides in our family room during these winter months, but is our patio and screened porch unit in warmer days. The Show is in the den where we watch TV, read or just hang out. It has become somewhat of our casual entertainment device - music while we read or search the web and answering questions about current, past events or just trivia. We enjoy viewing the occasional movie trailer and family/vacation photos. Then came the Spot. It is a perfect addition to the kitchen and resides on a shelf above the sink. My wife enjoys music while she works and the timer feature which is a convenient addition to the ones in the microwave and the stove. It is particularly useful for some recipes. We have occasionally used the Show and the Spot for calls to our daughter's Echo and cell phone. She lives about five miles from our home. To sum it up. the Spot is perfect for our kitchen. It is the right size, has a reasonable speaker and fits our lifestyle. Next is the workshop?"},

These little square cube cams are FANTASTIC! That simple. They say up very quickly, have 2-way sound, I can hear noises inside house, or I can talk to my kitties, no cameras I've bought have been half as easy. 5 star pics! Nice crisp, clear, and almost a fish-eye lens. It takes a wide view of whichever room it's in. I now have 4 cams. It would be 7 but I put 3 someplace to remember for next trip, now can't find.  Love these little cubes.  I also have some other wireless cams, that are way more expensive, are completely wireless, run on batteries. BUT do not have 2-way communications.

All I really wanted was a camera to keep an eye on my mailbox out by the road and any traffic to and from my front porch for package  delivery and such.  I was initially a little disappointed when I missed my wife pulling in the garage because the 5 minute cool down period between alerts had not reset.  But, after doing a little reading I saw where this can be bypassed with the use of a micro SD card which I had installed during the set up.  So, once I knew what I was doing, I was able to scrub back and locate her arrival along with all other activity between alerts.  It is my understanding that my 32 GB SD card can store 3 days of continuous recording and as I have set it to only record alerts, I would think it should last at least twice as many days.  I paid $25 for this cam and so far it is worth every dollar I spent and I am already planning to purchase a few more for me and you can bet I may get them as gifts this year for friends and family."},

Then the commercial break on most stations last 5-7 min.& comes on every 5-7 min.  Not an exaggeration!  The commercials are senseless too - 10 sec logo pop on between every 1 & since logo is silent & movie audio is so low, you think the movie must be back on - but no - the same ad keeps running over & over & the same 3 movie trivia\u2019s repeate over & over.  Other stations have just 1 :10 or :30 sec ad on before the movie pops back on & that happens about every 3 min.  There are video tracking issues too.

I moved the express location from the side of the tv to face directly towards the router, I haven\u2019t had an issue since I did this so make sure the face of the stick is completely facing the modem/router you have, it may not be as strong as the quad core 4k stick and it also was during heavy WiFi traffic during the day when it did cut out. I will continue to monitor the connectivity issues if this stick, if they subside and it becomes reliable I will repost, I have had the 4k stick lose signal once and a hdcp error once, otherwise I am content with Roku, I also have Apple 3rd gen and Apple 4ktv, but mainly bought the Roku for the Xfinity app so I can return my set top boxes.

It does show you how much time is left so if I'm watching a hockey game (GO KNIGHTS GO) and need to fast forward through a commercial break I know that it's going to be two minutes off the time left to play (17 minutes is pretty close for intermissions).  Some people believe that the IR only remote is a minus, but I look at it as a plus because it allows me to use my Harmony remote with the Roku.

I had to move one of the other routers, configured as a repeater, to within 10 feet of the Roku to get it to work (and then the signal meter only showed 2 \"bars\").  Note that other wireless devices such as the TV, PS3 and Android phones within a few inches of the Roku show the primary router signal as full (4 of 4  or 5 of 5 bars).  No wired internet port either so its wifi or nothing. The Express is out of warranty (90 days).

Simple to set up, very good picture quality, and a nice iOS app to go along with the unit. However, it does need a little polish in the following areas. First off, the motion detector, even set to the lowest sensitivity, is triggered too often. A slight breeze on a branch in a capture area will trigger the notification. Next, the time lapse download is triggering an error out of the blue. Short of resetting the device, I haven\u2019t figured out how to get it working again. Also, I haven\u2019t found a way to lengthen the alert recording past 12 seconds. It would be nice if it was possible, and if so, it was made easy to do. Overall however, in some ways, I prefer this over my Arlo for places that aren\u2019t too far from a power outlet. I would recommend this device for indoor usage where power is available."},

It's a cute camera and the picture/sound quality is really good, but the thing craps out pretty frequently (loses connection, etc). You have to restart it manually to reconnect it, which kind of defeats the purpose of the security camera if I have to be nearby the thing every time it loses connection to physically reset it. Isn't the whole purpose of the thing for me to NOT be near it for it to work?

My only complaint is that occasionally they freeze up and need to be unplugged and then plugged in but the value these cams provide is amazing! Image quality far exceeded my expectation!!!  Just wish the automatic clips that are motion activated/recorded were long enough to be useful. They're just too short to see what's going on. Only that something is starting to happen. For example, my cat enters the frame, the camera starts recording.  A few seconds later, that's it. You only see that the cat entered the frame. You don't see it go to the potted plant and pee. Another example, my kid comes into the kitchen and activates the camera to start recording. I get to see him get a glass of water. What I don't get to see is the entire bag of cookies he eats directly afterward. I try to use SD cards but for some reason, while mine worked for a few weeks, it doesn't work anymore. Not sure if that's a problem with the SD card or the unit."},

I'll set it up and the camera will work for a few days and then suddenly it stops working. I'll then delete the device from the app, re-connect it, and it disconnects again a few days later. This cycle repeats endlessly. I contacted support and after some troubleshooting steps, they sent me another camera that experienced the exact same issues. There were firmware and app updates that actually made the camera less stable. Now after the camera disconnects, the setup process keeps timing out, so it takes several attempts to get the camera reconnected, which is frustrating."},

I check on them multiple times per day to ensure they haven't sneaked out of the backyard.  I also used it while I was away and had people check on them.  For the price and what it does, it is definitely worth the value.  Would I use it as a security camera for my home?  Absolutely not, because the camera catches 12 secs of motion, which is usually my dogs approaching the door and not necessarily the person coming into the house.  I also noticed that after the initial 12 secs of motion, the camera doesn't send longer streams of video with the continuous recording, unless you go into the app and watch the video streaming live.  Sadly, I live in an area where I pay 0.20/GB of internet streaming so it could get expensive streaming 24/7.  Finally, the cam does record to the sd card that's house inside the camera but if someone were to take it, then the recording would be gone and all you would have would be the 12 secs of motion recording (that for me would likely just be my dogs approaching the door).  For all those reasons, this camera doesn't work well as a security system but it's an awesome pet spy cam!"},

I am having a bit of time getting used to the buttons, but I think that's just because they are different from our cable remote. I end up in places I didn't intend to. But I'm sure that will pass.

It looks very clean and crisp and only takes up a small spot on my nightstand. Just like all the other echo devices it works great for asking various questions. Getting the weather first thing in the morning is nice. There are also a number of different backgrounds and clock faces to choose from to make it interesting. Sound quality is great and music sounds clean and crisp. At first I was worried about having a screen next to me at night for a clock because even on dim most displays are still too bright.

I had no problems setting it up. Wifi from the house isn't spectacular, but this little guy had no problems connecting and staying connected. Alerts were sometimes slow at first, but I noticed considerably faster alerts when I finally put an access point for my wifi in the building, so I think it was more of a problem with my wifi coverage than the camera. The sound alerts are great, I get an alert when it hears someone at the door unlocking it, long before I get an alert on the motion. Night vision is ok, but it doesn't reach very far. This camera is pretty tough. I accidentally knocked it off the shelf it was sitting on. It didn't miss a beat and had no damage. If you have a large area to cover with night vision, this little camera may not be adequate enough, but if you have a small area to monitor or night vision isn't that big of a deal to you, then I highly recommend this camera as an expensive security camera.

I have a 16Gb SD card in there and it records video just fine. Playing it  back is somewhat of a chore. For example, I know when my kid left at approximately 8:45.

There is no \"Play\" button so I slowly scroll through the timeline thinking that's how I'm supposed to watch it. No luck. Never saw him leave. I finally find that it I just tap the screen (who knew?) it would start playing in real time. So after watching 3 or 4 minutes of no activity, I scroll again, tap the screen to start. I see the tail end of his exit. So I try to scroll to the minute before that and it goes back to my previous view."},

Four of my cameras are now installed and all are working well.  Setup was easy - all you need is a smartphone.  The video is clear and bright, though the lens focal length is a bit wider than I would really like.  Sound is OK if the person is near the camera, otherwise it can be just a weird warbling noise.  With micro-SD cards installed in each camera I have continuous 10fps 1080p recordings.  The cloud video is based on 10-second clips of motion or sound detection (if you elect to enable these), and videos and images during cloud playback can't be screen-enlarged as with the micro-SD card recordings.  But 14 days of free rolling storage of these clips in the cloud for each camera, free, is the best deal I've ever heard of."},

I originally became interested when I saw it on sale and started to investigate it's function.  I decided that it would replace my bedside clock radio and make it easier to change wake up alarm settings and wake up to interesting music selections (night mode was a plus).  Now I find I can add \"smart home\" devices and have ordered a wi-fi  controlled outlet for my living room lamp (I presently use an analog device).  I use the Echo to time my workout session on the \"teeter hangups\" (I used the timer on my Kindle Fire before; saves opening another device).

I love that I can go to sleep listening to nature sounds, sleepy music, or even have a book read to me solely for the purpose of falling asleep!  The alarm has a nice gradually escalating sound -- not a jolting loud buzz or static from a radio station that isn't tuned in. If I wake during the night I can ask Echo what time it is without even having to open my eyes. When I have her play music she'll show the lyrics, and I can get the news or the weather while I'm getting dressed. The numbers on the clock are nice and large, but if I can't see the Spot I can just ask for the time. She will also display or tell me the next few things on my schedule. The sound quality is better than I expected. I like to loop the sound of rain so that it plays all night while I sleep, and sometimes I forget and I think it is really raining! She also turns the light off (with the help of a smart outlet), makes phone calls, and adds things to my shopping list that I remember as I'm drifting off to sleep!

The form is solid and good quality and the screen is a nice size to sit by the bed; the power cord is a nice length for plugging in to a bedside outlet.  Really like that there's a choice of 'faces' and that there's a weather report built in. The gradually increasing alarm is perfect for couples who get up at different times, or even if you like to wake slowly, and a 'snooze' function that just requires a screen tap is much easier to activate than fiddling around with buttons in the dark.

It serves its purpose well and I like how much more intuitive it is with its screen. For an alarm clock it works very well for me, I don't listen to music on it since it's not really meant for that in my opinion but for watching movie trailers and such I like it. Like everyone else has stated there really should be an option to turn off the things to try home card, I don't need that showing at all. Maybe/hopefully with a future update that will be addressed. Also, I think there should be an option to have the display turn off/time out after a certain amount of time or inactivity. There really is no need to have it on all the time, I'm at work for 9 hours of the day anyway.. You can turn the display off by asking it but I'd rather not have to do that everytime I leave the room. Also, they should add an option for how long your snooze sessions are. My last concern is with the alarm, I came across the situation where my power went out and I'm assuming if it hadn't turned back on I would not have been woken up by the alarm. Maybe in a future iteration they could implement a backup battery so the alarm sounds in the event of power loss? Other than those small gripes I do enjoy the Echo Spot and if you're looking for a smart alarm clock I highly recommend you pick one up.

I'm a little surprised that Amazon would allow Roku to beat them at their own game when it comes to streaming devices, but que sera sera. I'm a consumer, and I have options."},

I reported the problems I was having to Amazon, and they gave me instructions on how to return the defective device.  After establishing that I would return the device, I was sent a new one within days.  I was delighted with the customer service, but now I am experiencing some problems with the new one rebooting.  So far I haven't had any catastrophic shutdown occur, but I am not holding my breath.  The problems I am experiencing may very well be a problem with a particular lot of the devices, I am not sure.

Keeping the same exact name as the older model was confusing, and phone support from Roku is almost non existent.  Also I am getting fed up with all of the one capability devices out there.  I would ditch them all if there was one device that supported all of the streaming services I wanted to use, and also had a bluray player, and OTA receiver and recorder, and perhaps a better way to share media from other sources.

Its small size makes it easy to find a spot in nearly any room in the house. Currently we have ours in the kitchen so we can add items to the shopping list, and discover the weather before heading out the door in the morning. The speakers in the Spot are clear, with nice sound that resonates throughout the large room. (I had complaints about the poor quality of music with the Dot, but not here). We purchased this model for the video chat feature, as we have family out of town.

It arrived in it's little box complete with the Spot, power cable (similar to the Kindle plugs) and quick guide.  As I already have an Amazon account and several Echos, the setup was relatively painless.  Once I got it online, and used the Alexa app on my tablet to get all the settings the way I wanted, this little thing started getting awesome.  I set my background screen, my Do Not Disturb times (that don't effect the alarms you set BTW) and night time display.  I played around with the Amazon Music, and while it doesn't compare to a full out Bluetooth speaker it still holds it's own and can fill our bedroom with sound.  The display, being rather small, is still quite clear and legible.  I can't see anything close without glasses but I have it set so I can easily read it.  The videos, again on the small side, were easily watchable.  So this Spot has replaced the alarm clock, bedroom radio, tablet and entertainer!

My husband couldn't see the clock the first night, so I turned off the night dimming function, cranked the brightness up to maximum, and found a digital face without a lot of background clutter (there are 6 digitals to choose from).

You should not depend on a device that requires constant external power and continual internet access to wake you up. Either use a cell phone, battery-powered clock, clock radio with battery backup, or heck a wind-up clock if you really need to get up at a particular time. The unit is attractive and takes up little room. Recently Amazon announced that Spotify and SiriusXM would now be able to be used across multiple Echo devices in a multi-room group setup. Don't know about Spotify but if you add a Spot to your Echo group SiriusXM does not play across the group though you can listen to the service on a Spot only.

The Spot seemed like a natural to replace the Echo Dot and old school alarm clock on my nightstand. I really like how the face gets sufficiently dark at night so it does not distract you from sleeping. One glaring mistake that I cannot see how they missed is the volume buttons are totally flush with the surface. It is almost impossible to feel them in the dark which is basic alarm clock design. It's also a little pricey but I'm sure over time it will come down. A few other things. The receptacle in the back for the power looks exactly like the audio out and neither is labeled.

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Great next step for the Echo line", "review_body": "The Spot is a nice addition as it does fulfill a specific role/niche in the Echo line-up as a smart alarm clock.  It is an excellent bedside \"smart home\" companion but it is equally at home on a desktop.  I've been steadily adding to my Echo collection since I pre-ordered the original Echo before they became available.  The Spot is the most useful overall especially because it can easily be paired/connected to a better speaker so open spaces like a kitchen are also a good fit for the Spot.  The set-up is simple and seamless.  Generally, I think people who are disappointed or otherwise disillusioned with the Spot are so because they don't take the time to fully tailor the Alexa app and Echo so it can best learn their preferences.  If you want the most out of the Spot it does take an investment of time to set-up your voice profile, and learn about and try some Skills unique to the Spot.  There's just more to it than a basic installation and expectation it can do anything imaginable.  The challenge is to take the time to experiment with it a little to prevent a \"now what?\" moment.  It's not perfect, but I for one really like the direction Amazon is going in with the Spot.  I knocked off a star because the Spot would be perfect if the screen could somehow stretch from bezel to bezel.  It's not that it's too small to be worthwhile, but that little bit of extra screen would go a long way."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I'm Lovin' It!", "review_body": "I bought an Echo Spot primarily to use as a bedside alarm, but it's so much more! I'm new to the Amazon Alexa world so I'm still learning just what this thing can do, but it's so much more than an alarm clock: Waking up in the morning with instant access to my weather, calendar, news feeds and music is awesome. Sound quality is on a par with a few of the mini Bluetooth speakers that I've seen and the screen quality is quite good. My few quibbles are minor: The adjustable stand should have been included with the Spot. As an option, it's WAY overpriced. Also, manually accessing a few features needs to more intuitive (volume, alarm controls). One additional thing: My wife discovered that Alexa could bark and meow! The Echo Spot now gets my dog's stamp of approval too!"},

The Spot then didn't appeal as a clock. The Show is on the kitchen table for phone/TV replacement, etc. Dot is in laundry room because it has the lowest quality sound. So, I put the Spot on the end table next to my recliner. I use it for so many things I wonder why I didn't jump on it the day it came out! It also has better sound than the Dot."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great alarm clock", "review_body": "This is a great echo device.  I wasn't looking for another echo because we have an echo (first generation) or echo dot (second generation) in each room.  I had been interested in the echo show, but the price seemed high for a replacement echo and it seemed bulky for the places I would use them.  When they echo show popped up, I could justify the price and size.  I decided I wanted to use it as an alarm clock in my bedroom and I have been happy so far.  It replaced an echo (first generation).  The microphones work fine even all the way across the room.  The auto dimming at night works well so no glaring clock on my nightstand at night.  I use the sleep sounds skill as a white noise generator and the speakers sound good.  I like that I can pull the video for outside Arlo cameras and the picture is very clear, yet small.  When I pull traffic and weather it shows me all of the options for traffic and the full weather forecast on the screen.  My only gripe is the repeating alarms need to be more customizable.  If I want to cancel an alarm for a repeating weekday alarm for one day, I need turn off the whole alarm.  I then need to remember to turn it back on.  There doesn't seem to be any indicator on the clock face that the alarm is off to remind you to turn it back on like a regular alarm clock.  Correction: it does show the alarm setting on the clock face, including the time it's set for, so I upgraded my rating to five stars"},

It works great and my parents have told us the picture is great, my only complaint is that since this has to be connected to a power source, we can't move it around as we talk or we drop the call. I wish this had a chargeable battery so we could move from the dinner table to the living room and continue the call. The screen & camera are fairly small, but work pretty well on the receiving end.

It currently resides on a bedside table, and it's duties are primarily to be a wake up alarm.  The basics, this thing is BUILT, I think I could drop it and it would be fine, but I'm not going to test that.  Great speaker, solid, easy to set up.  Already a \"Prime\" member, so it's a snap.  First thing I did was turn off the camera.  Seems a bit dodgy, that.  If I ever want to make a video call, I'm now ready.  Alexa can be frustrating.  It is fun to tell her to arm phasers and set them to kill.  So, currently, a wake alarm, plays music from my one and only playlist I set up.  Easy to set that up BTW.  The biggest and dumbest thing that I actually can't believe, is Alexa does NOT support wake up playlist shuffling, so here I am, playlist with 27 nice songs and music, and Alexa can ONLY PLAY THE SAME SONG EVERY MORNING.  Now that makes one wonder why have a wake up playlist?  I don't know who is asleep at Amazon in the Alexa department, but this is the single most irritating factor about Alexa and the whole \"echo / spot\" thing you can imagine.  And that's why I only give it 3 stars.  It IS a 5 star device, and it is chopped back to 3 not because of build quality, sound quality, clock quality.  It gets knocked back to 3 stars due a mindless apparently unimaginative \"Alexa\" crew at Amazon.  Come ON GUYS, can't shuffle a play list in the morning, TOTALLY STUPID.

Besides the usual Echo features, I'm going to focus on the Spot's feature as a clock. I love that I can change the clock face to whichever I like. The Spot also dims during night hours, which you can choose the range on. It automatically brightens when you turn on the light at night so can you see the time. By default, the Spot's face displays the time like a traditional digital clock. As for the alarm, it can only only set one alarm at a time (by saying, \"Alexa, set the alarm to 7AM\" among other variations) so when you need a different alarm after your first time, it will erase your earlier set alarm - which is fine, since setting up the alarm is so easy anyway. It can also set up timers and other features. You can choose the sound/tune you listen to as well. This is pretty much the smartest alarm clock you'll get, among the other things this Spot can do (make calls, face time, play music via blue tooth, read to you, etc.).

To be fair it is not included in recorded video or snapshots it is confined to the realtime view. #2 I've fitted a memory card so the camera records locally BUT despite this the camera when it detects motion records for approximately 1 minute then does not record again for several minutes.

I have echo's new and old all over the house including an echo show.  Didn't end up needing it as a gift and fully intended on returning it.  I figured it's small, sound wouldn't be great, and doubted the usefulness of such a tiny screen. And as others have mentioned you could get a show for not much more dough.  But it kept staring at me so I decided to open it and check it out.  So here's the thing...it's flipping adorable!  And it's perfect for what it's designed for.  Perfect for the bedroom and a perfect alarm clock. Realized the speaker is adequate for the bedroom (I had to actually think about how very little I listen to music there).  I also realized all I use my bedroom echo for is alarms, weather, and some smart home stuff. Sounds better than the dot obviously, but no bass due to its size so no where near as good as a regular echo.  Nice touch to add audio out via cable and Bluetooth in case I ever need it.  Also it's really nice to see my calendar reminders, the weather, and see my Amazon cameras. So yeah, the lil guy really won me over within 15 minutes.  Reminds me of the little chumby I had years ago! Some random things I saw in other reviews that weren't right btw... Yes you can turn off the tips, yes you can connect speakers, phones and headphones via Bluetooth, yes you can disable the camera (or tape over it if you're really paranoid), yes it gets really dim at night if you want it to.  Also I know some reviewers complained about them (were almost offended by them), but I really like the tips!  Even though I turned them off on the spot, I use them all the time on my echo show.  I am an expert user but the \"try\" this tips can be fun and informative.  Alexa does ALOT so it's nice to learn a couple new things or even be reminded here and there. The only knock is the price. But like I said, spend a little time with it and you are like fine!...I really like you!  I'll keep you, even though you're a little too expensive!"},

That freaky experience aside, I am really happy with the Echo Spot as my new alarm clock. 98% of the time Alexa understands what I'm asking for when I set an alarm, timer, etc. Other benefits include listening to Audibles or sleep sounds with a sleep timer set after I have Alexa turn off the lights, having Alexa give me my daily report on weather, traffic, news, and sports every morning that I wake up (and even turning on the lights to mirror the outside sun as it gets closer to my alarm), waking up to personally selected music, playing Head's Up and Yes Sire, etc. It's basically the smartest alarm clock I have ever had and I am taking full advantage of it thanks to Prime Day!"},

To stop the alarm, I just say \" Alexa, stop\".  It's also a great deal to get the amazon music for about $5 a month, which allows you to play any song at any time.  I love to set reminders about things I need to take to work that day, or ask about the weather as I'm picking out an outfit.

The main problem I have is the night listening mode on the app, as it disconnects often, even a few feet in front of the TV with a clear view. I'm SO glad I purchased this, as it's a great cheap replacement for cable!"},

I was excited to spend less than $150 on something that could presumably stream the same way. Well this thing worked fine for a month and now can\u2019t find or hold my WiFi signal. My other devices have no trouble, there is nothing wrong with the signal. After trying the \u2018helpful\u2019 list of troubleshooting and moving the box around to try to appease this piece of trash and spending too much of my time sitting in front of a loading screen trying trying to tough it out I just went ahead and ordered the new Apple TV. Roku has ZERO customer service- unless you buy one of their more expensive products you don\u2019t qualify to talk to a person for help they only send you the same list of troubleshooting moves that do not work. Also I found out by reading forums that this has happened to lots of other folks and just seems to be part of the risk you take going with a Roku. It\u2019s true, I am a scorned customer and my review is biased- I know happy Roku users, but Apple comes with a warranty and customer service. I\u2019ll never stray again."},

But it's OK I suppose. My biggest gripe is that there's no 5G support on this model. Maybe other Roku models, but not this one. What does that mean? When you run your microwave, you'll lose your TV signal for a few minutes. They use a similar frequency (2.4 gHz). When I used the FireStick which as 5G for a different service, I didn't have this problem because it's a different frequency. My suggestion? Get a Roku with 5G or a cable service that supports FireStick."},

He speaker volume is great for its size. I can control my hue lights with my voice and multiple other WiFi outlets.

Not even a power switch! After the one-time setup, you can move it wherever you like without additional adjustment, just plug the USB power cord into a power source (PC or wall plug w/ USB adapter) and you are off to the races.

It replaced an old clock/radio that wasn't the easiest to read at a distance at night.  The simple modern design matches well with our furnishings. She likes the colorful modern themes during the day and the night mode is very easy to read (analog version in our case).  We also got the Echo Connect which allows us to use the Spot as a phone and eliminates the need for one in the bedroom.  We did get the stand which is pricey for a piece of plastic - but it does make it easy to adjust the angle so you can read from a distance.  In a way a breakthrough to using the Alexa/Echo ecosystem for us."},

When the Spot came on the market, I was sure that I needed it or wanted it. I was just going to buy another Echo. I decided on the Spot and glad that I did. It's the perfect size (great on a night stand in the bedroom or end table in the living room) and is the right mix of Echo functionality with the added feature of being a clock. The screen is perfect for viewing quick videos and pictures. Havent tried Drop In yet, but seems like a very cool concept. Overall, the Spot is simple in concept but provides a wealth of uses and benefits. Really loving the Echo line of tech and cant wait to see how it evolves."},

I wish there were more ways to customize the wake up word (right now there are only four) and getting personal pictures into the clock face is a minor pain in the butt."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Echo Spot...", "review_body": "I love this thing, considering that I have 3 dots! To be honest, it has, more or less, become a fancy, modern, 21 century alarm clock, that answers questions, more or less, more often than not. I do love the sound, the sound of music because of its speaker system, considering I still use an external bluetooth speaker, every now and then. The screen is too tiny for me, if I wanted to see something in the middle of the night, I would have to find my glasses and that is no easy feat. And I do hate the fact that it does not broadcast YouTube, which I spend many hours watching, usually in regard to camping. As I was reading some questions and answers, someone mentioned that it has no snooze. But, I just read...that you can just ask Alexa to \"snooze the alarm\"...learned something new today. I have to try it tomorrow morning. I just usually just say stop and then wake up 30 minutes later. Now I have to get the Echo Show, for a better viewing."},

I put it on top of the garage door facing the drive way, and then set detection area to close to the house, so it doesn't pick up everything. Email notifications comes with about a minute delay, so don't expect instant notification. Reviewing recorded events is very easy with the app. I put in a 64GB micro SD card and set to extend the recording (not continuous recording), so I have both the 12-second notification and extended recording, if I want to review on SD card. Only downside on night mode is the front led (infrared?) attracts bugs which trigger the motion sensing occasionally. In day time, movement of my palm tree's shadow on driveway also triggers the sensor."},

The only minor negative comment I have is in a one week period of time, I'll have maybe one of fourteen cameras not respond to the software so I have to unplug it for a few seconds from the wall socket, plug it in again, and it starts working again immediately.  Overall, excellent security system for the price."},

My favorite feature is the screen is always changing showing suggested videos recipes, ideas, things to try like skills or movie trailers. It keeps you in the KNOW. You can personalize the home screen/screensaver with your own photo etc. It is super intelligent - if it can not find what you ask it will give you suggestions. You can be vague like Alexa play a comedy from Amazon Prime video or more specific like Alexa play Dates from Hell Season 1 Episode 6. You can set your alarm to a song not a sound so you can wake up to your favorite song! I would need a clone to have enough time to explore all the wonderful functions, features, skills. She is such a great companion.  You can say show me your deals and you can shop, make lists, even make cat sounds - which my cat is a fan of. My cat was injured this weekend - we asked Alexa how do you care for a wounded cat. She gave me so many steps - better than a nursing assistant. You can video chat and the picture, call and sound quality are PERFECT!!!!!! There is nothing Alexa can not do. I have several dots - now the kids use them. You can enable music everywhere so I can play music on all Alexa devices throughout the house. It is perfectly compatible and super easy to set up with my smart home devices like EZ Viz cameras. I say Alexa show me Mom's room or the living room! Perfect for teens and a mom who is always working. It is not heavy and portable but is sturdy stable an robust. The length of the cord is helpful.

Roku really feels like that much of a step forward into a new way of watching TV. I watch  lot of videos on YouTube, and to now watch them on the big screen, just like watching \"normal\" TV, is really fun and I love it. It took a little figuring out the first night to get it all fully functioning as I wanted it, with the right \"channels\" and all that, but the time it took to get that all just right was minimal. Compared to how much I love it now, the set-up was absolutely nothing. It is actually very simple to set-up, and very easy to navigate, once you get used to it. Now, after a few weeks with it, it seems like how did I ever watch TV without it? It literally is that great in my opinion. So, yes, I can wholeheartedly recommend Roku to anyone!

If you want a shopping list you simply say \"Alexa, create a shopping list (you can name the list to be store specific) and Alexa will add anything you want.

So the fact that I don't have to rely on my phone for an alarm clock anymore, and I don't have to use it to check the weather before getting ready for the day, is a huge plus for me. I like that I can set important reminders so I can have a fresh reminder in the morning (again, without having to rely on my phone). It doesn't take up much space at all, the display is crisp and clear, and I love that you can watch Amazon Prime on it, even if it is a small screen. I will definitely be recommending this to friends and family who are looking for something similar to what I was looking for. The camera is a little creepy.

It\u2019s a very nice device, but since I also just installed my Echo Connect to my home VOIP phone system, I\u2019ve found a shortcoming that should be able to be remedied by a software update: Making phone calls is very simple, however, many calls to businesses require a key entry (e.g., \u201cPress 2 to connect to a technician.\u201d) and that would be simple if the Echo Spot had the ability to display a phone keypad during a call. That feature is very similar to how the in-call screen works on an iPhone. The Echo Spot would find even more applications in my home, if I could use it in lieu of most of my cordless phone VOIP handsets. When I\u2019m at home, even though I can place a call on any of my iOS devices, they still aren\u2019t necessarily convenient and I like having voice capable fixed-location devices. With the number of Echo devices I have deployed, I can make typical calls from anywhere in the house, without having a device in hand.

Correct, once you have registered your device with your account, and now have access to an alexa config page on your amazon account, you cannot do anything useful with it unless you use a smartphone with the alexa app.  Mind you, as dumb as this is, it gets worse.  You can only use the alexa app on smartphones produces within the last year or two.  Android 8.2 or newer, for instance.

The echo spot seemed like a great replacement\u2026 smaller footprint\u2026 many more features than a simple alarm clock so I purchased it.  Everything was fine until last week when the Alexa voice informed me that 1010 WINS was moving from TuneIn to Radio.com.  That\u2019s fine.  I thought I would be able to just reset the echo spot to use Radio.com.  No can do.  After August 1st the echo spot just beeps when the alarm goes off (annoying).

For a little orb the sound is quite satisfying. Set up was easy just like all of the Echos. The fact that I bought it when Amazon had it on sale was just the icing on the cake.

The mic is not very sensitive but it works well enough to get the job done. The app is okay but needs work. There are no thumbnails for the notifications so all you see is a timestamp and a default picture. The notifications are only 12 secs long and have a 5 min cool down period in between them so without the SD card this thing is pretty useless as a security camera. Also the notifications are delayed by around 4 min making it not suitable for a baby monitor or a ring replacement. It is a good pet monitor and that is what I bought it for.

There are just a few problems that cause it for now to be 3 stars. First, setting the alarm and turning it off can be quite hard, especially if you try to shut it off with a touch.  You also have to use the exact word, STOP!, to make it shut off  for that day., or if you say anything else will shut it off permanently.  Also, the weekday alarm does not work at all. If you set it for weekday, after the first day it just doesn't work. When I check the iOS Alexa app, it shows that the weekday alarm is on, but the Spot doesn't recognize that it is still on, and misses it the next day. The only way to get the weekday alarm to work at all is to turn off and then back on for it to work. I have found a workaround for my problem. I have set up five separate alarms for Monday through Friday to get what one weekday setup should have done. Yes, I did contact Amazon, but they still haven't fixed the problem. This isn't a new problem if you search the web. Hopefully the software will be fixed soon so I can change my rating to higher."},

Next to the bed while I had the flu, Spot was entertaining with little snippits that could be activated to watch or roll on to weather, etc.  The clock is visible, but dims when the lights go out in the room so that it will not keep one awake.  Thank you, Amazon."},

The more I use it, the more I find it can do.  The speaker sound is great for such a small device (the size of a softball) and the screen, while small, is crisp.  Unlike some Alexa-compatable devices, like Vobot, the Spot has full integration with Ring to video show the front door, Nest, Remotesy (to verbally control most of your remotes) and Pandora (with lyrics displayed on the screen).  As a father of two teens, I need the lyrics (or the kids make fun of me for loudly singing fake ones)!"},

There is nothing better than being able to set your alarm for the next day when it's dark in the room and you are already in bed. For me, this is by far the best benefit and I would gladly pay for this function. It also has a good speaker and plenty enough volume to fill the bedroom. I removed one star because the screen is not functional for much other than to make for a nice clockface. It is too small to watch any videos. My only other gripe is that there is no backup battery, so if I do lose power one day I guess I'll be late for work. Overall happy and would buy it again."},

The Spectrum cable digital converter box rental is around $9 per month and we can use this Roku to stream the spectrum cable app for free in place of the Spectrum cable digital converter box. Works great with all the same functions of the Spectrum cable digital converter box plus the compact design allows it to power from the TV USB port rather than a external power supply. Roku does add the external USB AC wall power adapter with cable if your TV does not have a USB port. Our spare bedroom TV is a 720p HD Plasma and this unit will do 720p and 1080p. The HD quality is perfect. I have a Roku 3 in a different room and the Roku Express (2017) units WIFI performance is better than the Roku 3 for a fraction of the price. For $29.99 I would not hesitate to replace a $9 / month Spectrum cable digital converter box with this unit if you\u2019re already paying for the Spectrum cable digital service and have Spectrum cable WIFI. I\u2019ll probably order a few more just because this unit is so small and does not require the external power supply, plus it out performed my Roku 3. I used 3M double sided tape to mount it to the bottom of the TV for good remote IR range. Roku does provide some double sided tape and it's too thin for mounting the unit to the bottom of the TV with good contact."},

The cameras have night vision as well and it is superior to the canary! The highly defined images are much better too. Alerts to movement or sound, which can be turned off if you prefer. You can also record continually and watch uninterrupted by moving the timeline back. You can also take snapshots or  video  to keep  permanently. A 32 gig sd card is all that is needed. They swivel and adjust to any position and they come with mounting plates or you can attach them to metal surfaces as they have magnetic bases. AND...there is no subscription fees or costs of any kind, Canary can't say that! You own these amazing cameras with no strings attached. You buy one of these, and you will buy more!

Alexa can hear, and understand you in your most grogy incoherent morning self. If you can't see the screen without your glasses near, or across the room, just ASK Alexa... what time is it? What's the temperature in the room or outside? Ask what the thermostate is set to before you dare let your big toe out from under the covers. Have Alexa turn off your TV instead of fishing for the remote,  because you know, any movement you make will take you out of that \"almost asleep\" state.

I also really like the choice of watch faces - they even have some that work great for those of us with less than perfect vision so I can tell the time without my glasses!

I\u2019d also prefer the speaker be louder than it is. Most of these are minor issues that can be addressed with a software update. The speaker maybe not so much.

It'll find almost any radio station on either TuneIn or iHeart, so it won't skip a beat.  You can obviously also use Spotify or any other music streaming too, but if you're setting the bar low, as I am, it overachieves.  It's also nice to be able to ask it for time and weather, without opening your eyes. You need to use the slow Alexa app to set things like graduated alarm, so it doesn't come on blaring, but as soon you figure that out, you're good.  I guess you could do all these things, with any of the other Alexa devices, but if you're like me, and still like the concept of an alarm clock on the night stand you can look at.  In that case, this is a major upgrade!"},

If you put your hand on the top of the spot to tap the top of the screen, you\u2019ll mute all future alarms.  (Happened to me more than once).

Plus, when you do multi room music, the show will only play on it's internal speaker and I had a nice pair of powered bookshelf speakers I wanted to use.  It switched back and forth constantly if it was streaming multi room, just this device, etc.  The new Spot has a 3.5mm speaker jack, so that is no longer an issue.  All audio comes out of my speakers.  The size of the Spot is perfect for the bed stand and even with my fuzzy vision without glasses, I can easily see what time it is at night. Note to Amazon: We still need the ability for an Echo device to be in more than one multi-room music group!  Right now, if you have an \"everywhere\" group and put all your devices in it, you can not then do an upstairs or a downstairs or an outside group.  Multi-room music is great!

So, still was not wanting to spend $20 on the Spot stand. I decided to do a DIY stand. It works better.

The video is clear only when nothing is moving. It's blurry when the subject is moving which makes it useless. The alert detection is a hit and miss. Sometimes it will send you an alert, sometimes not. And if ever it did, the video is about several seconds delayed like the subject was almost already out of the frame before it starts recording.

The only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is because the sound is a bit muffled since the speakers are on the bottom of the device. The sound moves downward towards whatever you have the device sitting on. The speaker should probably be on the back of the device.

I am extremely light sensitive (hotel room smoke detector LEDs are the bane of my existence) when sleeping and so was worried about having an always-on screen next to my bed but was surprised to find that the auto-brightness on the screen goes very very low automatically and the clock face switches to a black face with yellow hands which further reduces the brightness.

I set everything up for him and tested it, right off the bat I didnt like how you have to have the sensor visible in order to use the remote. Its very ugly to have the sensor dangling across the tv set. In addition once my father started using it, every time he would watch something and a commerical comes on, it stops playing whatever you are watching and you have to restart it all over again. Since i am not close enough to work on fixing it, I am going to get him the Amazon stick instead since I have had zero issues with it."},

Only true downside is it has a camera built into it, be nice to have an option that didn't include the camera, especially since this is marketed as a smart alarm clock. Only other thing I can say which is neutral is that you can't edit the alarm music from the app, and specifying the alarm music through voice commands can be a bit finicky.  She will sometimes understand what you said and list the correct playlist as the alarm other times not so much. In the end it means just deleting the incorrect alarms and repeating the commands a few times till she gets it right. I marked this as neutral as I think this will improve with time."},

I grandfathered from a 3 year old Amazon Fire Stick (first version) and after 3 years it was getting slow. So it was time to upgrade. Choosing the Express was great, because I don't care about UltraHD, or 4K. I just want to be able to stream Amazon Prime or Netflix and whatever else I can. And the 2017 Roku Express version fits the bill. To start: It's very fast to load any app or any movie/TV show. With the Fire Stick I had to wait several seconds for buffering. Not with the Roku. This thing moves. So I don't have to wait and look at the little turn circle in the middle of the screen. Yes, you have to put the receiver somewhere and attach it via an HDMI cable to your TV or receiver. Guess what, mine can't even be seen between my other devices. So it's great. Second, the Roku App for iPhone. I love that the app gives you an exact view of the \"remote\" version and it's touch and not swipe. So you don't leave smudges on your phone. My only con: I wish this remote would come with the TV volume control and TV power. But oh well, saved me $25.00 and still works exactly like the stick. It's great that you get a decent remote, an HDMI cable, batteries, and even adhesive tape for the ROKU if you need it. I'd rather not deal with sticky after-messes with the tape. It just sits there on my shelve. And finally: the ROKU Channel. Watch movies and shows at no extra cost. Variety is great. Yes, just like YouTube watch 1 o 3 ads and then continue.

I have this on my desk at the office currently and would like to have it slowly rotate through weather and my schedule or something, but the things to try is totally distracting mentally if not visually.  I don't want to continually be processing (in my brain) what Amazon is pushing to me.  There are suggestions of how to fix it, but none of them do what I want -- I just want this eliminated from the list of things it rotates through.

You can buy these direct from Wyzecam for $19.98 each with free shipping and you can even use your Amazon Storecard to pay for them.  I just ordered 5 more.  these work great and pretty easy to setup.  Plan on buying a mini SD card for the cameras in key areas you monitor.  When these cameras are triggered by motion they only record for 3-5 seconds and there is a delay in the start.  If I walk into my den from kitchen and then turn around and walk back to kitchen the recording misses me coming into the room.  So if you want longer than a 3-5 second recording, thats where the mini SD card come into play.  a 64 GB card (about $17 from Sandisk) will record continuously for about 14 days.

Anything over that you have to pay $10 for every 50 gigabytes over that. All day TV junkies beware!  There is some buffering involved--some channels are better at it than others."},

If someone comes to rob your place and the door opens slowly (or whatever) it will show you a nice video of that, but not the person robbing you (because they will just take the camera with it's local storage) so it's is pointless for security.

You plug it in anywhere and It connects to your Wi-Fi so I can easily be moved around the house anywhere I want it.

With a little software upgrading, this will be the ideal option for folks who want the convenience of the Echo but don\u2019t want to take up valuable real estate on your desk or table."},

The app is simple to use and well thought out. I showed the camera and its features to a relative who recently dropped by & he ordered one immediately after my demo.In the past-I ordered a well known brand of home surveillance camera which was over twice the price of this one and it never worked properly if at all. This camera is touted as secure from being hacked by passersby in your neighborhood.

While the price point is one of the primary attractors, the quality of the hardware and software did not disappoint in any way. I currently have two of these little cameras monitoring my home, with settings tailored to fit my purposes. As other viewers have mentioned, there are some software issues to be worked out, notably the limited network compatibility (this device can only be used on 3G networks or lower) and delays when multiple users try to access camera feeds simultaneously. Overall I'm getting more then expected in this reliable and easy to work camera."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great cameras that I highly recommend.", "review_body": "WELL worth the time and money for these amazing little guys. I have had several different surveillance cameras in my time. And these have been the best so far and the cheapest oddly enough. Setup went very smoothly with my Android phone. I tested One camera for about 2 to 3 hours and went right back and ordered 4 more. Yes there are some limitations to the app itself but for the price it is not a problem. All you would need is to download an app called tinycam Pro from Google store and it covers all the missing needs from the wyze app. Also I would say adding a mini SD card is a must if you would like to have a continuous recording of all events. Right now I have my SD card running for about 2 days and it is half full so I would say it could hold about 4 days worth of video and then it will record over itself in a loop. The main addition with the tinycam Pro app is an easy-to-use live viewing of all your cams at once (pictures attached). With that app it is easy to arrange and see your cameras live all on one screen. Next I have the outdoor covers on order and can't wait to try them on the front yard and backyard. Yes I highly recommend these cameras for any home use you can think of."},

Half the digital clock options are formatted this way and its hard to read. There isn't one single option that maximizes the screen size to make the time more legible. And unless you're sitting on your bed staring at your nightstand- anything else about the digital display is useless because of size.  I wanted to try an Alexa device and also wanted a different alarm clock from my old ugly screeching one. As it stands my old clock is on one nightstand so I can you know, tell the time- and the Spot is on the other. I could've just ordered a full size Echo with better sound for $30 less and still wake up to music, sets alarms etc.  If you want a visual device get the full sized screen model and wait for a sale.

I originally gave this a one star since it did not do what it was advertised to do, namely show me my Ring Pro front door camera.  This was the only reason I purchased it.  All it shows is \"Waiting for Ring.com\" with a blurred view of the last thing it had in memory for the front door.  On a hunch, I stayed up late and tried it again. Much to my surprise it worked almost immediately, but showed \"Buffering...\" every other second.  My past experience is that this is a server problem and not a device problem.  I think that the Ring server in Dallas has difficulty communicating with me in Houston, TX.  Since Amazon now owns it all, I presume this will be remedied since Houston is the fourth largest city in the USA and many others will have the same problem.  So far, I like everything about it.  It is very intuitive to use to the point that I have not even watched a YouTube explaining it.  Telephone calls are crisp and sound great on both ends and do not require the other party to have an echo. Amazon---please fix the Ring camera problem!!!  This is a buy recommendation."},

The only other thing I can think that might cause this is that they for some reason tested this with people sitting and standing around it but not with someone laying in bed. Not sure if your voice changes that much when prone or if it has an issue understanding commands which are not pointed right at it. The ring seems to be searching in random directions for our speech just before it craps out and wants you to try again.

For the price and quality of this product and the use I needed it for I really like it! It exceeded my expectations. The night vision doesn't work as great as I'd like it to... I have to turn on my porch light to really see anything. The talk back option and sound works great! The picture is clear, although you really have to place it in the right lighting otherwise it's hard to see faces when people come to the door. The only reason I'm giving this an overall 4 star is actually because of the app that it is required to use. The app's playback option to watch your footage playback what it recorded is touchy at best. When I want to go in to see the whole footage of playback material it freezes or doesn't play half the time. This got frustrating. However the 15sec clips that it records when there is motion at the door always works and sends instantly to my device. Overall I would probably only get these cameras for my house indoors but for the time being they work great as my front door surveillance! I would recommend this product."},

The interface is better than others that I've tried. The flexing hinge is a feature that is nice to have as well as the magnetic base. The only problem I had when trying to contact the Wyze by phone is they put you on hold and then hang up after a very long wait, referring you to their website. This happened three times in consecutively before giving up. There is little if any information on the included cloud storage.

I am trying to figure out how best to use it at this point.  Originally, I wanted to see how much my cats moved during the day.  The upshot is:  nearly not at all.  It would be more interesting to watch paint dry.  The video footage is clear and the app works great.  I'm just not sure I have the ideal amount of house activity to capture interesting footage.  It might be used for security, in which case I hope it catches nothing, since movement on the perimeter would be bad."},

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Good value, good support, UX needs tweaking", "review_body": "\u00a0The WyzeCam is a good cam as long as you know its limitations. The first limitation is the length of recording when motion is detected. Recording is about 15 seconds. I hope recording length could be lengthened via firmware update. 15 seconds isn't long enough if you are going to use it to video porch thieves, or have it outside by a bird feeder recording song birds. The recording I've attached to the review is a recording of live view. When you install the iOS app, and go through the installation, users need to accept all the notification switches because viewing cam footage in the cloud is dependent on accepting notifications. The cam records at 10fps. You can see how an increase up to 30 or more would improve the video. The motion activation works well, It picked up an ant crawling over a rock about a foot away. When you open the iOS app, it opens to a still image. You touch notifications at the bottom of the screen to see if you have any videos based on alerts you have set. To get to the live view, you move the image left by touch. To move back to the notification page you need to touch the arrow on the upper left, you can't swipe left to return to the previous page. UX note: 1. all the functions at the bottom of the initial screen should be on the Live View page. 2. User should be able to disable the mic so that zero audio records. 3. Recording of live view ends when you leave the live view page. It would be better if recording continued until the record button is pressed again. 4. When you delete a video from the Album, the app asks you twice if you are sure, this is a good thing, but if you delete a video from the notification page, it just deletes it directly, without giving you a change to back out of the delete. Notification page deletes should have the same UX as the Album delete."},

I'm not a big Alexa fan, I just don't find that handy, but I do think this is a cool gadget clock.  Some shortfalls is there is not many \"skills\" other than weather and time, but does work nicely to have a weekday alarm only to Prim Music of your choice.  Another shortfall is the camera in the bedroom.  The software on the clock says that the camera is off, but is it really?  It's also always listening to your conversations.  Waiting for wake word Alexa.  So, not sure I like that either.  If you hit the mute all button, then the clock turns obnoxious Red color, so you really want to turn the listening back on to get rid of that.  Another thing is that you can't turn off the alarm early on the clock's touch screen.  Maybe I don't want to wake the wife, but I would have to say, \"Alexa, turn off alarm\".  That wakes people up!  My Bose alarm clock I can push a button on the remote to turn off before alarm time.  There are other little things like this that come up.  Would like more functionality on the LCD settings so you are not forced to speak to the device.  It also shows current temp.  Not that handy in 6AM.  I want to know what the high for the day will be, and I don't want to ask it (again to be quiet with still sleeping spouse).  I just want to see it on the rotating screens.  So, let's hope that this improves over time with software upgrades.  So, the last work is that it's a mixed bag."},

The set up was really straight forward. My issues and the reasons for 3 stars started to crop up after I downloaded the app. First, maybe i'm crazy, but when I searched the app store for the app using the alexa keyword, I got several amazon apps. the first was Amazon Prime Music. The Amazon Alexa (music), then Amazon Music. It wasn't hard to figure out which was the one I needed, but the Alexa app is categorized under music which I thought was weird. After downloading, I assumed the app would be a slick, user friendly, and intuitive. I found anything but these characteristics. its clunky, very intuitive and just strange. Amazon, you can do better than this. The whole concept is great, but I really hate the app. Another negative was when I was setting up an alarm (since I plan to replace my bedside alarm clock with this. It took several voice commands to get the alarm set. Through some web searches, i was eventually able to get a weekday alarm set. Not intuitive and Alexa didn't seem to understand to set an alarm for every day. So then comes the alarm choice. What a weird selection of tones. Come on Amazon, you can do better. So not I decided I would rather wake to an i heart radio station. I tried dozens of commands to get alexa to do this (no the app wont let you just type in what you want, in fact the app doesn't even indicate that this is possible). Finally, I went back to the web to do searched to find out how to do this. I eventually found the exact wording to make this happen. I assumed alexa could do this stuff, but I am finding it very limited. Oh yea, dont even try and understand how to hit snooze or cut of the alarm. I dont want to talk to alexa in the morning and wake my wife, just want to touch a screen or button to make this happen. Eventually figured it out,but again, totally not intuitive at all. So Amazon, great concept, its just not there yet."},

The only complaint I had was there was no published description of the purpose of the usb A female connector on the back labeled \u201cusb output\u201d in the manual. Fortunately, my query to WyzeLabs support was answered with a clear explanation that the only current supported use of that connector is that up to 3 cams can share a single instance of the provided power adapter by daisy chaining using this connector. It was not stated by I believe that implies that a higher powered adapter could support even more daisy chained cams. So the suggested stacking of cams with different viewing positioning for wider area coverage becomes even more feasible and neat. Again, another SMART feature (wonder why it is not advertised)."},

USB Web cams were also limited in field of view and performance vs. price. AHD dvr have high resolution for wired cameras but ip cameras take up multiple channels on them.

I'm running both cams on the beta software/firmware channel so i'm not sure if all of these features are on the stable release yet, but it pretty well goes toe to toe with the Arlo.  In fact i find the app to be much quicker, and connections to camera live view to be quicker.  It trails Arlo in some areas like geofencing, but beats arlo in some features like free onboard non-stop recording, time lapse, and motion tagging.

I got my Wyzecam last week and put it through test, the pairing was effortless, it was very easy to pair and the cable is long enough, if you need a longer cable you can always purchase one. The app works well, I haven't used a micro-SD card yet but the motion sensor has picked my puppy walking around and recorded it on the cloud and it also sends me notifications like the Arlo. The night-vision is good enough for you to distinguish things, I am very surprised with the quality of the video given it was just $20.

Customer service was initially responsive to email but has gone silent.  I'll use this as a basic dumb cam to monitor things, but you get what you pay for."},

It does NOT push notifications out consistently.  Mine did for a couple of days, then nothing.  The Wyze Cam forum discusses this as it seems to be a common problem.  Customer support seems non-existent as they do not answer their telephone or respond to emails.  It does actually display images on your smart phone and they are quite acceptable, but I NEED the advertised notification function and that does NOT work, nor can it be fixed apparently."},

We point 2 of them out 2 front windows in order to monitor the front of our home. They are easy to mount, easy to install in the app, easy to rotate & easy to zoom when in live streaming. My 2 complaints are small (1) the USB chord is too short to put the monitor above the windows inside, (2) the recorded videos are not able to zoom (you can zoom when it\u2019s a live feed, but when accessing recorded video you can\u2019t zoom-in to see specific details)."},

The camera is incredibly sensitive so it sends you alerts if a leaf falls which is annoying and makes it so you don't even look at your alerts anymore. Also, my roommate added herself to the camera and now I'm kicked off and will have to reset it to fix it for me. I like the free cloud space but this thing is basically useless. I might as well hook up my dropcam and pay for service again since it will do what its supposed to."},

Yes, the system occasionally froze, which could be bad if it happened in the middle of a vacation, but still, for he price, nice.  However, after not using the camera for about 3 weeks, I turned it on about mid January and the app immediately performed a firmware update.  After this I had a LOT of problem with the software which froze up my phone, and I mean froze it up badly!  The screen went completely black and the phone become unresponsive for 2 - 3 minutes at a time!  I uninstalled, and reinstalled the App...same thing.  Despite wanting to use it for monitoring on an imminent vacation I was too fearful that it might mess up my phone for good during a vacation, so I finally uninstalled the App and will wait a month or two, hopefully they will have figured out the problems and come back with a good solution.  So much potential in this...too bad.  By the way, my phone was a Motorola Nexus 6 using Android version 7.0."},

I\u2019ve been impressed by all that this hardware and software combo has to offer. Setup was seamless. The hardware performed and looked as I expected. The software has been excellent. Over the course of a few days, filled with me playing with all the feature, I only had one minor hiccup in the software. I accessed the live view remotely, but it wouldn\u2019t load ... but I tapped live view just a second later, and it was silky smooth as usual. The notifications for motion and sound work flawlessly, though I can corroborate what others have said that even the least sensitive motion setting is still pretty sensitive. But I know how to position the can bow that I know this. Overall, this may be the best $20 I\u2019ve ever spent on a piece of tech.  The software will only improve as time passes.

It is still a bit cheaper if you buy more than 1 on their website as shipping cost decreases per camera as you order more WyzeCams, but with Prime's 2 day shipping, the camera will probably arrive a bit more quickly using Amazon.  I had to backorder my 10 as they were out of stock both on Amazon and their website, but they were shipped within 5 days of placing my order, and they arrived well before Christmas, although the website said they wouldn't arrive until after.  Set-up was simple, the quality of the picture excellent, the alerts work well and allow me to open the app and check what is up at home if I need to. Also so cool to be able to speak to my wife and kids at home through the camera if I want to.  And the 14 day free Cloud  storage of alert clips is a real boon!!!  Highly impressed at what one gets for a quarter of the price of most other WiFi video cameras.  Wyze labs - thank you for an excellent camera that is amazing value!!"},

I've had them for a few weeks now and I find the features and performance go way beyond the $20 price tag.  I highly recommend signing up for the beta program.  This will get you the firmware and app updates before they get released to the public.  Haven't had any problems with the beta software so far, and you get to use the new features and functions earlier.  I like the notification options and find them to be pretty accurate.  Lots of features to fine tune your notifications, as well as the motion sensitivity and area of motion that the camera should report on. I have one camera outside, under the front porch roof, and it's been fine out there so far.  No real extreme weather, outside of a little rain, and it's still kicking.  I'm still hoping they come out with some kind of enclosure for outside use.  All in all though, I've been really impressed with these cameras, especially for the price.  Night vision is outstanding (assuming it's not pointed out a window, the ir reflects off the glass.  I bought three originally and then bought two more a short time later.  I'd recommend getting a 32gb or higher sdcard as well, as that will allow you to store and view a bigger archive of footage.  Also allows for creating time lapse movies.  Setup was super easy.  Only glitch I found was that it has a limit on the number of characters that your wifi password can be.  I got around this by setting up a guest network on my router and giving it a separate (shorter) password than my other wifi devices.  My advice is to buy one and give it a try.  At $20 (plus shipping on the Wyze site), it's a very low risk proposition.  I think most people will end up buying a bunch of cameras after trying out the first one.  May not work for everyone's needs, though."},

Initial setup was easy with the Drop Cam (called Nest Cam now) and the video comes in clear with a nice zoom in feature. However, I failed to read the reviews of the Nest Cam Alexa Skill before purchasing as a number of people call out that it times out after 30 minutes. I discovered this and thought it was a bug or connection issue, but alas it is by design. Since there are two companies involved, I'm not sure who is imposing the 30 minute limitation, but for my purposes it renders the product useless. If you're only going to use it to check cams occasionally, then this would be a great product. However, if the intent is to leave it on for hours as a baby monitor it won't work. This might get fixed by Amazon or Nest/Google, but I didn't want to wait around hoping so I returned it and reverted back to using a phone or tablet as a bedside monitor. Also, since Amazon and Google have been squabbling lately with interoperability, I wouldn't hold my breath on this getting fixed. P.S. I considered replacing the Nest Cam with the new Amazon Cloud Cam, but that product doesn't seem to be fully baked yet."},

I use it as a bedroom alarm clock, and I like the features.  You can select from several different clock face displays.  This display automatically dims at night, but that feature can be modified in the settings function, along with many other parameters.  The display also randomly lists different suggestions for the device's use, which is helpful.  The flash briefings do contain some video.  I'm a fan of talk radio, so mostly I use it at different times, along with the Dots, to listen to various stations.  The sound quality for that use is surprisingly good.  Frankly, while I think that these devices are fun, I don't find them particularly useful for me, but that may be partly my own lack of interest in trying to learn all of which they may be capable.  I'm in my sixties....  I did buy a smart switch and use the Dot/Spot to turn a lamp on and off.  It works fine, but I'd rather just use the switch.  I guess I could go crazy and get wifi smart door locks, thermostats and whatever else is available, but as the saying goes, you can't teach an old horse new tricks.

I tried again and this time, TWO pictures came out; one blank and the other with a picture of someone's house already developed.

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "It doesn\u2019t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with ...", "review_body": "This is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  I use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  Audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  Much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  It doesn\u2019t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  Try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying \u201cAlexa set an alarm for 5am\u201d and then having Alexa repeat \u201cOK alarm set for 5am.\u201d  Not good.  I suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  Plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990\u2019s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  I know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  No thanks, if I\u2019m picking up my phone to set an alarm I will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  At least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  The interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  There should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  Currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  It is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  When the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning Alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while I\u2019m in the shower."},

I've been talking to Alexa since the day she was born in 2014.  I have the original echo, the dot, the silly dash wand, I've had a eufy speaker, I've connected to a sonos speaker.  In short, I'm all in when it comes to this wonky world of digital assistants.  I EAGERLY awaited the release of the spot not because I needed another digital assistant but because I need a really good and functional clock on my night table that has Alexa smarts.  I wanted something that could reliably wake me in the morning to one, two, or ten alarms if I so wished. That could wake me to either an alarm or the music of my choice.  I wanted it to be able to give me the weather (previously I've used the dash wand but just last week when I asked the dash to give me the weather, in a sleepy voice she replied \"I'm too tired right now\" or something to that effect.  I thought I'd mis-heard so I tried again but again she said she was just too tired.  So I think you can see why I would want to have her replaced as a bedside assistant) or tell me what time it is when I awake in the middle of the night and don't want to roll over to see the clock."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Awesome Film", "review_body": "I must say that I am really impressed with the Fuji camera as I received it as a gift for Christmas.  The only bummer was that it didn't come with any film! Lucky amazon carries the film and it is fairly prices. I believe I paid around $15 for the 2 pack which means it's less than a dollar per photo.  The film is kind of cool in that it comes in a cartridge that you easily put in the camera (it even tells you what end to put where, so you don't have to worry about putting it in wrong and I believe the camera will not close if the film is in wrong).  Then you just point and press the button to snap a picture and in no time the little film strip pops up out of the camera.  It takes a good 20-30 seconds for the picture to show up, but you can always help it develop faster by waving it around.  The pictures are nicely printed and are great keepsakes.  I defiantly plan on buying more film to use in my camera and hope Amazon will continue to sell it at a good price."},

But there is a work around.", "review_body": "As I am sure many have or plan to, I bought this to use as a pretty cool alarm clock. Well there's a huge issue with that and Amazon, seems not to be too concerned about fixing it. So these devices have separate volume slides for timers, alarms, notifications from the main volume. I have mine set as high as it can go. But then I want to go to sleep listening to some music.  Obviously I set the main volume music to play at a low volume, so I can fall asleep. I then set the alarm to wake me up at 7:00 am. So what happens. I fall asleep with the music playing at volume 2, and then I wake up around 7:45 am. I notice the alarm on this device is going off.. But it's at an even lower volume than I had set the music for the night before. I'm like WTF! I was glad I wasn't relying on this alarm to wake me up to catch a morning flight, which is sometimes the case. I can several tests that morning. What I discovered is, if you have music playing, any timer or alarm which is set to go off will go off at a lower volume than the playing music and will totally disregard the volume setting of the slider bar specifically for alarms, timers and notifications. I sent a feedback notifying Amazon of this issue and except for a short \"We will look into this\" they have done nothing for the past couple of weeks. Well this device is totally useless as a bedside alarm and I'll go back to using an alarm I can trust. I gave Amazon time to fix this, but I'm not holding on to it past the return period. So this thing is going back to Amazon until they can figure out how to make it a functional alarm clock."},

Customer service after 8 attempts finally told me last night that the verbal command does not work and will delete the alarms, it is being worked on by the developer, (the all powerful developer it seems?)? They told me to just use the UI or the swipe gesture. When I told them again for the 17th time that the swipe gesture for me did not work and deleted the series of alarms after it shut alarms, they said it was being worked on by the developer. When I said I have been told this 27 times and nobody is getting back to me and I purchased this mainly to use as a smart alarm clock and the verbal command and the physical UI swipe both should work and not delete the alarm series, again I am back to square one. Waiting for a week for them to get back to me now, if not will pack up and ship it back. Sad for $150 with the stand not to be able to use the spot as an alarm. Who would want to set it every night.

I think I have too many too close to each other and it seems to overwhelm the system.  I thought I would be able to launch apps on this device and watch Netflix or Sling TV like the fire TV, if you can I have not figured it out.  To view my cameras, I was able to connect one of the camera apps to Alexa app but can not \"show me\" this camera.  I probably need to sit down and try to figure this out, just thought it would have been more user friendly and less putsy to have everything work together.

We live on a dead end road with no neighbors close by, so there is very little wireless interference.  Regardless, I changed my router's b/g channel from Auto to channel 1, but this did nothing.  I found some articles online having to do with interference mitigation on Roku devices - it appears lots of people are having this problem - but the instructions I found for how to turn it off did not work.  What's more, it simply cannot find my 5G network even though every other device in the house finds it fine.  When I went to Roku's site for support it informed me I cannot call for support, and that \"Agent-assisted support is not available for your issue and/or model.\"  So it's a useless piece of junk for me and I can't even return it because the dog chewed the remote.

I spent about 10 minutes trying to get these mounted before I realized this. Another ten minutes and I was able to disassemble the power strip, use a utility knife and some needle nose pliers and perform some minor surgery to remove the unnecessary piece of plastic (second picture), re-assemble, and now the power strip mounts just fine (Last picture). I'll still use these becasue they were cheap and now that I've fixed them I shouldn't have any more problems, but it is annoying that the product design group didn't bother trying to slide any screws into the screw slots otherwise they would have realized this issue."},

There are two mounting slots on the back, but they are poorly designed. They have the traditional keyway slot, but once you get a screw head in the larger side, you can't slide it all the way into the shorter side because there is heavy excess plastic in the area. If you rely on just the two mounting slots, the power strips will wiggle. There is no way I would try these to stay mounted on the underside of a cabinet, for example -- just the place I had intend to use them. So I had to trade one of the power strips under my desk for this one since the one I already had had four mounting slots that were designed the right way."},

Ample space between each set of holes so that you can actually use each and every one. The 2 pack makes this even more convenient.

Most plugs are of a size to where six will comfortably fit in the strip. Also, the strip is narrow enough that it fits easily between the wall and furniture such as an entertainment center. The black color is often inconspicuous nestled against dark cabinetry. The cord is plenty long to extend between the wall outlet and what you need to plug in. The fact that it\u2019s a surge protector is an awesome bonus to protect your electronics. So far, these are working great for me."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Simple Surge Protector with a Very Short Cord", "review_body": "Power Strips are a necessity of modern life, basically every television and computer in your home needs one for all the accessories you plug into them. So a two pack of power strips is definitely something worth picking even if you do not need them because you never know when you will need another (I went through a stretch where three stopped working one summer).  As you would expect with AmazonBasics, these Surge Protectors have a simplistic layout with six ports.  Though they are pretty close together so if you have more than one cords with the bulky heads, they will not fit very well in these.  There is one other small complaint and that the cord is extremely short, two feet long.  And since about half a foot is going from the wall outlet to the floor, you will have to set these power strips right next to wall outlet.  So if you want something more versatile, you will want to buy something else."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Economical...with costs.", "review_body": "Even though the indicator light said it was protective, a surge went through my laptop when it was plugged into this and fried a transistor on the motherboard.

While this is an economical choice, I'll stick with Belkin to protect my most valuable equipment and use these for items such as lamps."},

I had only used the camera for travel so I found this very odd. I hadn't dropped it or anything of that nature but the camera is clearly damaged. I believe that it is a manufacture default so if you are looking into this camera for reasons similar to mine, DONT look into this item. I would say it's fine for a little while but expect for it to go bad."},

I bought myself one for Christmas and am thinking I may buy more of these!  It is very easy to set up.  Originally I was going to use it in my home office but since it has an alarm I decided to put it on my bedside table.  I can set the alarm to wake me at a specific time with music of my choosing.  I can also link it to my phone book and it calls on command.  I like the small size but the sound is not small.  The music sounds great.  This was a great purchase!"},

I figured it could replace the oldschool alarm clock radio I had in there before, and I needed an Alexa device thereabouts anyway to control the bathroom lights. Figured this would be a good voice-activated replacement that could show me the time, play music, show me upcoming calendar events and give me news briefings that I could listen to and/or watch, all while getting ready for work in the morning... far more functionality than I could ever get out of my 1990's alarm clock radio. The Spot works great for all of that. The only reason I am knocking off one star is the mic pickup. While the Echo seems to very rarely fail to pickup a command (and often amazes me by picking up my voice when I think it won't), the Spot does fail occasionally. There have been times I've even been left wondering how the heck the Spot didn't hear me correctly, or didn't hear me at all. I know, it has fewer mics than the Echo, but still. All in all though, great product and I am enjoying my purchase."},

It is hard to get a centered picture as the viewfinder of the camera and the lens are not connected.  There is a lot of guesstimating going on, I have become a little better at times, but find it overall frustrating and disappointing.  The pictures taken inside tend to be dark even with the automatic flash of the camera.  So I have had to discard a lot of pics for my purposes.  This is about 64+ cents every time.  On average I get about 7/10 satisfactory pics.  I am new at this and I am always shooting inside.

I use it as a feature rich alarm clock and as far as that is concerned, it supersedes all expectations. The only drawback that I've noticed is that the speakers are subpar at best and often crackle. It isn't clear at all and it's extremely bothersome when you're expecting it to at least broadcast it's sound clearly. If it were not for that I'd give it 5 stars but for a product that requires voice feedback, this is an extreme disappointment. If I were advising a potential customer, I'd say wait for the next generation and see if it's speakers are updated because as for one of the more important parts of this product, it definitely falls short. The software on the device itself could have been better as well. I feel that you should have more options as to changing the clock face instead of just the few included or adding a picture of your own.

I find that asking Alexa to do simple things like set a repeating alarm for weekdays and for that alarm to be a specific radio station is not an intuitive task.  If you do not word the command in a very specific way (something that is not my normal way of speaking - and I'm a native English speaker) she just doesn't understand.  It took me about 10-12 tries before I could get her to understand my command.  The other issue - if I have a repeating alarm for weekdays and I want her to turn it off specifically for one day without changing anything else - OMG.  After half hour of trying various ways of trying to get her to understand the command, I just gave up and turned the whole alarm off.  What a waste.  As for linking with other smart home systems - again, same issues.  If you do not use a very specific sequence of words Alexa just doesn't understand the commands.  It's not very natural language friendly.  I once asked her to estimate the time it would take me to get from home to the airport - clearly not something within her scope.  Other than that, I don't think I've use the Echo Spot for anything other than news, weather etc And those commands work fine."},

Sometimes it also gets stuck while the alarm is going off and I also have to unplug it to shut it off.  The other thing is the clock display is not big or clear enough to read without my glasses. My eyesight is not that bad either so I can imagine how someone that has bad eyesight won't be able to see anything. I have tried all the different faces and brightnesses. I could be missing something but I can only ask for the alarm to snooze by voice but can dismiss it by swiping up.  I do sleep alone so that isn't so much an issue but I bet there are bed partners that would rather someone didn't have to yell out for alexa to snooze."},

I ended up buying it on the 5 monthly payments (it's so much easier to justify $25 or so dollars a month), when my alarm clock broke. I already had an Echo Dot which I actually did not use often but I really ended up liking the Spot. Its design is pretty (I bought mine in white), it can set multiple alarms, and yes you can set it to snooze without trying to croak out any words. The speaker is fine for bedroom/small room use, and the automatic dimming of the light is really great especially for people like me who hate any light when I'm trying to sleep. If it weren't for the price, I would have given this great little tech toy 5 stars."},

It's a just a skill, not the recipe for nuclear fusion.  The Amazon Echo Spot was easy to set up and otherwise works....but in the end, it is little more than a dot with a screen that does not show me anything my Nest thermostats don't already show me (temperature, weather, time).  Interestingly, I also tried to set up a \"routine\" that would turn off our Hue lights when we turn in at night.  Turns out (and I checked with Amazon's Customer Service), you can use a routine to turn \"on\" your lights, but not turn them \"off\".  It would appear they have not figured out how \"off\" works yet.  Not to worry, I can still turn them off by telling Alexa to \"turn off all lights\", I just can't associate it to a phrase like \"good night\" within a routine.  I guess we should be grateful that Amazon don't sell airplanes...having one that can take off only to discover they have not figured out landing yet would be unnerving."},

The sound is fine and the screen is nice to have but I have been experiencing issues with the device and responses.  Very often I will give it a command to play music and it will say part of what it is going to play and then stop...and then nothing.  Many times I have to repeat this command 2 or 3 times in order to get the music to play.  Same thing with my Flash Brief.  It will say my name and it will start like it is going to begin my flash brief...but then it just stops.  Same with playing Jeopardy. So the issue isn't just a skill.  I have done a search for this issue and haven't seen this with anyone else.  I know that I didn't and still don't have this issue with the Echo Dot.  In the week that I have had the the Echo Spot... I don't feel that it is worth $129.00.  This is more a personal preference, but I just don't get that much from the screen to justify the cost of the device.  I plan on sending the Echo Spot back and look at getting either another Echo Dot or the Anker Zolo Halo."},

I have enjoyed them quite a bit.  but I am looking at the whole ecosystem thing very hard.  Amazon vs Google (ring) etc....  so I am evaluating lots of features.  I have the first gen echo and a dot.  just bought the spot.  I was hoping to see a couple of things with the spot that I do not have.  and i was thinking it would be ok.  but it hasnt been great.  First, I wanted to use the Spot as clock while I sleep.  wake up and look at clock.  one problem, I play ocean sounds or rain while I sleep.  so I can't really look at the clock while the music plays.  Second, I wanted to have a spot and a dot around 10' away from each other.  I tried to group them.  it took a while.  I already had the dot in another group with the echo.  maybe that's the problem.  but I wanted to play both dot and spot in one room.  so far, I can't get it to do this successfully.  I think the UI in general isn't great.  and the whole echo system leaves a lot to be desired when using multiple devices in groups.  I think it may get better.  or I may figure out how to do some of these things.  but maybe I am asking too much.  either way.  I think I should be able to do these things.

Thought to buy this Echo Spot for my bedroom since it would look good on a night stand. And it does. Got a refurbished one for much less. In the morning, I set reminders (not alarms) to tell me it's 530am, 545am, 6am, 8am. Alexa speaks at 530am - which wakes me up. It also sends a text notification on my cellphone. Somehow, for the 545am reminder, it sends a text reminder to my cellphone BUT does not speak up on the Echo Dot itself. The moment I ask it a question like \"What's the weather?\" or whatever, it starts to give me the answer then it's suddenly interrupted by saying my 545am reminder all of a sudden. I thought maybe this was happening only because it was a refurbished unit. After several chats and attempts to fix the problem like rebooting and resetting, etc., Amazon replaced it. Second one had the exact same problem. Returned second one as well. The Echo Spot is pretty but its interface/OS is severely flawed. So disappointing. Sticking to my 2nd gen Echo for now."},

You have to search online to try to find how to keep it from rotating to various screens, and even if you dig deep enough in settings to do it, it will on it's own, randomly, revert back to the old settings at some point.

Amazon missed the boat by making the stand a separate purchase.  For what it costs to produce the stand, it is overpriced and may be an indication of simply wanting more profits.

In short, It makes the whole experience of using Alexa more relevant.  To be able to see the snippets of information its telling you about, to see the timers you set, albums that are playing really make the whole experience complete.  I am using this one as a bedside clock and music player and its done a fine job at both.  The mikes seem to pick up my voice better then the Dot it replaced and the speaker is actually ok.  Your not going to get thunderous bass but for casual listening, its fine.  The unit itself is well made and has a little bit of a heft to it.  It does not feel cheap in any way.  Downside is that the smaller screen definitely makes things like watching video a chore and for looking at albums in prime music, or anything else that shows a bit of data, you really have to scroll around a lot more then the show. I highly recommend this..."},

Drop in does not even remotely work, the voice comprehension is still not fantastic, and it rarely uses anything visual. Maybe it would work if all my relatives also purchased echo spot devices?

I tried making a call to someone with another Video Alexa.  Despite being able to receive a call from them and previously communicating with my other Alexas - the Echo Dot could not find the contacts.  Setting my alarm was annoying.  Setting the alarm from the device has the most annoying throwback alarm sound.  And setting it from the app means nothing might happen.  This was suppose to be the device to wake you up with the your own music.  There is a disconnect with the promise of this device and the delivery.  I am not going to return it, in hopes that either an update or another interface will improve my issues with device.  I normally get few things in the first generation phase because of everything I am experiencing with this device. But since Amazon has another video device before I thought this would be safe.

It takes up way less space and is more useful than the traditional alarm clock/radio, but with the bells and whistles of the Dot - plus the ability to use as an intercom and play your music throughout the house if you have dots. We haven't tried the phone feature, and the pictures are small, so not useful as a \"display,\" but overall we're pleased to add this to our home. A little pricey, so if your budget is thin, stick with the dots and make do, but if you can swing it, it's a cool gadget."},

It wasn't until I was in his room that I noticed how bad the distortion was.  I then tested this connecting to our downstairs Echo Dot and experienced the same thing.

I would have liked to have understood Greta's motivations a bit better. When I researched the people this story was based on, I read that Greta was a lesbian. If that was true, it would give us a better insight into what drew her to Einar (a man that was particularly feminine and not entirely interested in Greta to begin with) and also explain why she was so open and encouraging for him to become his true self. I feel like the author and Holly Wood thought they needed Greta to be straight in order to give a wider audience a character they could relate to.

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "easy to install. fast photo result. photo quality needs improvement.", "review_body": "I bought this since a good friend of mine gave me the fujifilm camera. I was skeptical about it at first but since I knew I wanted to use the camera, I bought 3 packs. So far I have used 2 packs. It works as advertised. The color is not as great but then again, I know I cant compare it to the printing photo quality from photolabs like pro dpi. regardless, it had served its purpose. its easy to install on the camera. once you unwrap the foul packaging, it will have drawings/signs of what not to do and arrows to guide you how to place the film in the camera. this was a nice reminder. like i said, even though i was not a big fan of its quality especially when the photo is taken indoors with poor lighting, i really like the fact that i can see the physical prints immediately. another plus factor is the size. for my project, the size is perfect for my daughters baby book. Because the borders are plain, it gives me the freedom to either decorate it with the patterned frame stickers that are sold separately or to keep it as it is. its really a fast and easy way to capture moments when it happens and have that chance to share it right away."},

I wish Amazon would make the screen more relevant, and easier to use - it's a touchscreen but a lot of things have to be done through the app. I don't think anyone is going to watch videos on the tiny little screen. Would be nice if it could display the radio station AND the weather and time .... rather than just doing one thing at a time. There's room for improvement, esp considering the cost, unless $150 bucks worth the cuteness factor for you - and the clock face (which is handy)."},

When I saw the Echo spot, though, I fell in love instantly!  It looks great, does everything the Echo does plus the video capability.  It didn't earn 5 stars because there's no way to shut down the screen for the night (and who needs that shiny screen on while sleeping?). You have to turn off the unit, completely, to have your blackout room ready for night time.  Also, the instructions aren't clear (not difficult to figure it out but still) and you can't do set up/configs through the Alexa App (why?).  I do understand it is a new product and it will probably be improved overtime but since this came after the Echo show (which has been on the market for some time now) I expected those minor, silly things to be worked out already.  Another bothering point is: if you are an Arlo user, don't expect this to work very well.  It takes multiple attempts to get the cameras images up."},

I chose to order this, replaced my alarm clock, iHome and Bluetooth for my Amazon music. Echo Spot has all the awesome features of the show, but fits perfectly anywhere! I personalized my home screen, live the new features the Echos without screens have, along with all of the awesome thing Echo is capable of. Super pleased with my Spot!!!"},

I'm sick of things offering \"things to try\" which cannot be shut off.  And when I try to play music, it's constantly trying to upsell to other Amazon music services.  Occasionally it activates when I didn't say \"Alexa\".  It often find music I've bought as MP3's digitally from Amazon.  Some of the games were fun at first but became a passing fad.  The clockfaces are too limited.  Alarms have to be set daily.  Alarms, if not around when they go off, never time out and just continue to run until someone yanks the power or eventually comes back to shut it off, which could drive neighbors crazy."},

The Alexa feature isn't as smart as I thought, it doesn't confirm your request, it just assumes and executes. Many times Alexa has called the wrong person, or played the wrong song. If you ask it \"Alexa settings\" it doesn't know how to process that request, but if you ask it \"Alexa go to settings\", then it knows what to do. You can actually ask it \"Alexa fart\" and it will actually play a nasty flatulence sound. lol but it can't find \"settings\".

Devise is not capable to discover smart devices. It could be just a lemon, or some setting I am not aware of (no manual),but it is unusable for me. I will try to exchange it and will update my review if replacement works."},

I finally gave up and put the darn app on my smartphone and got it working.  But OF COURSE, echo took MY contact list, so MY privacy is now invaded.  Now the relative bought a Smart switch to turn on a lamp while lying in bed, but now I just discovered I have to put yet another APP on MY smartphone to make this thing work.  IF AMAZON IS GOING TO MARKET THESE DEVICES TO THE NON-COMPUTER LITERATE ELDERLY POPULATION, then why in heck does the owner have to have 1) an Amazon account, 2) an email account, and 3) a SMARTPHONE?

I would understand maybe not being able to set new alarms without internet, but a reoccurring daily alarm should be something this basic computer should be able to handle.  Yes it would require programing and some work on Amazon part because they have no offline functionality at all for any of their devices besides the Kindle basically, but if you're going to sell me something that looks like an alarm clock, and has an alarm and a clock in it then it better be able to wake me up in the morning even if my internet goes down.
