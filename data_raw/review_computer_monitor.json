I have hundreds of NASA photos on my desktop and it feels as if I'm approaching a nebula the color and definition is so extraordinary. However, attaching the base arm to the monitor was no simple feat. After calling Acer and finally get past the obnoxious auto-responder, an agent instructed me how to go online (via my cell phone) to get the manual. Yeah, Acer doesn't put the actual manual in the package, just the Quick Guide which states that the monitor should be removed from its packaging carefully since the base is attached. Then, what am I holding? Kinda looks like a base to me. Attaching the arm to the base - piece of cake. But getting the arm into the bottom of the monitor, ah, not so much. When I got on the Acer website, following the agent's instructions, I was unable to find a manual - just the legal agreement. Time to do a Google search, which lead me to a YouTube video where the man took a flat screwdriver and snapped a piece of plastic off his R271 monitor to get the arm into the slot. Okay. So, before I've even had a chance to plug this puppy in, I have to break it. Sure, makes sense to me. But, it worked. I managed to fit the base arm into the monitor slot and the monitor isn't wobbling now."},

Since I'm using these for a home office setup, I have no idea about their performance for gaming. Perhaps someone else can comment on that use case. These monitors are pretty thin and lightweight, and the power brick? Wow! These consume so little power that their power brick is super small.It's smaller than a pack of cards, which is a welcome change. Could they have integrated the power supply into the monitor? Sure, but having it separate does aid the user in determining what has gone wrong if the monitor suddenly stops working. Whether power supply replacements will be available after the warranty period is another question, but if you're like me, you've got a drawer full of power supplies with the same voltage, same barrel connector, and same or greater current capacity, so finding a replacement, even for testing, is just an exercise in rummaging through the spares bin."},

The factory settings are only set to this max limit to impress buyers in stores and when they turn on the monitor for the first time!

I have tried several calibration techniques to make up for the difference but have yet to succeed.  Which brings me to the confusing and difficult to use monitor setup controls. They are on the bottom, which I like, but using them is very difficult. I have setup dozens of monitors but every ACER monitor has the same crazy layout and control pattern for the monitor setup. Finally this monitor does not have the standard VESA mount on the back. If you want to do a multi-monitor setup on a single stand then you will have to purchase an adapter.

I use a Datacolor Spyder to set my display color to the profile the printer is using, so that what I see is exactly what I get.  After calibrating the color for this monitor, I have found that it is at least as good as the Asus 4K monitors, but with one feature that I find sort of amazing to me.  This is an ISP monitor.  With a other LED monitors, it can be tricky to make sure you looking at the monitor from right in front of the screen.  If you are standing looking over my shoulder, or kneeling looking up at the LED monitor, the brightness will be slightly different.  This monitor does not behave in that way.

It's bright and clear with no dead pixels. As someone has posted before a couple corners on the screen seem to glow a little when you have dark images on the monitor but are not noticeable if you have brighter images on the screen (not something that really bothers me whatsoever). I think this is happening because the screens aren't perfectly straight when you look over the top of the screen from the side (almost as if you're looking down a rod to see if it's straight). They are slightly warped but not enough to notice unless you're really looking for it... I think it's causing pinching in the corners and affecting the lighting. These are things you should expect if you're spending only $130 for some large IPS monitors so I have no complaints about these issues and overall the picture is great for the price."},

That full brightness default is really really bad and probably will cause light bleedthrough and other such things to be far worse in a far shorter time than it should be.  I googled around a bit (I don't have proper calibration tools) and read a review that said to set it to standard mode with 99, 96, 100 colors with a brightness around 35-40% (I ended up finding 35 to be the best balance.)  The default contrast of 80 was about right, but I found it a bit easier on my eyes to go down slightly to 75%.  With this it's about as close as it's going to get without needing special adjustment software to get white balances and such exactly right.  It should default to something closer to this sort of level and let people adjust away from ideal to suit their tastes rather than having to adjust towards ideal.  If they do this for the sake of store displays (and come on, who puts an IPS panel like this up in a store display?) then it should simply have a store display mode like most devices have that set settings appropriately."},

I tried a VGA cable, and that worked. So, I put the original HDMI cable back into the back of the monitor again and pressed hard, and it worked that time.

I\u2019ve use high end Dell monitors that cost much more than these and I often find myself wishing I was using these instead. They\u2019re HD 1080p resolution, have an ascetically pleasing thin gloss black frame, have standard VESA mounting, and have VGA, HDMI and DVI inputs. For the majority of users that\u2019s everything you need and these frequently have rebates that bring the pricing to unbeatable levels (although the rebates does take months to arrive). I also bought my first monitor used from Amazon Warehouse Deals at a good discount and it arrived in perfect condition with merely an opened box (was probably just a return) so even if you\u2019re skeptical of used electronics, it might be worth giving it a try. The only thing that is subpar about these monitors is the stock stand. It\u2019s actually terrible. It squeaks like crazy if you shift the monitor at all, has no height adjustment and only minimal tilt adjustment. However, this is far from a deal killer as this monitor has a VESA mount which means that any cheap monitor mount on Amazon will fit it and be a huge improvement over the stock stand. You can even get a nice dual mount if you\u2019ll be running multiple screens.  After 4 years this is still just as good a deal as when I first bought it, the specs are competitive with newer screens, and it doesn\u2019t seem dated. I highly recommend these screens; just make sure to purchase an aftermarket VESA mount at the same time.

Still a great deal, co bnsidering I originally was considering a $300 24\" monitor.  Thorough video reviews by computer bloggers all rate this monitor very highly."},

I RMAed it a second time, they shipped me an entirely new panel with a new serial number (with a Feb 2015 production date) that had the exact same problem. At this point it feels like they changed subcontractors (Foxconn to Quanta, or whatever) and the new supplier just plain makes defective products. The only thing they can do is RMA it a third time, which is three times too many. At this point it feels like Asus is in Breach of Warranty and has sold me a product that is unfit for purpose and is unwilling or unable to repair or replace it under the terms of their warranty.

One has the images frozen on the screen, buttons are unresponsive, and the only way to power on and off is by removing the power cable. On the other three units, when you turn the computer and monitor off you have to select the input EACH time you turn it back on, to set it to HDMI or VGA or whatever. its ridiculous and my clients have repeatedly unplugged or turned off their computer because they believe its not turning on and call me to tell me something is wrong because they power everything on and there's no picture until you cycle through the inputs to select the correct one. Its UNACCEPTABLE and any old monitor with multiple inputs gets this right. I wont be buying these again. ASUS was once a respectable motherboard company.

I haven't calibrated this and don't intend to as most users will simply grab an HDMI cable and plug it in so that is the way I need to run it.

Acer promptly addressed my concerns and had me sent the monitor back, they then replaced it with a new one. I've been shopping for a 144hz monitor for gaming, but found I can set this monitor to 77hz in the Nvidia Control panel using my GTX1080 graphics card. It will also run at 70hz, but every other frequency including 75hz will not show a picture, just a gray screen. It does take about a minute longer to show a picture when waking from sleep at the higher frequency, but no problems after that.

The monitor itself came with 4 dead pixels (1 in upper left corner, 1 in upper right corner, 2 in lower right corner) which is to be expected but they are unnoticeable.  There is also no backlight bleeding which is a plus for myself as I do a lot of work at night.  The monitor stand is durable and the only downside to installing it was that some force had to be applied to lock it into place on the monitor (had to be pushed into the slot).  Once installed though, the tilt feature worked very well (height cannot be adjusted).  Overall, I will be purchasing another of these to finish my dual monitor setup as it definitely is made of quality!"},

However Acer's other cheaper units don't have an HDMI port so that was one of the reasons I went with this one instead. I have a Viewsonic VX2370SMH 23\" IPS that is better really but this monitor holds its own and I really dig the cool (and functional) stand on it.

I have read about some of the issues people have seen and I cannot find that any of these are true at all. I am a geek too. I have been in IT for 30 years from Administrator to Architect. I demand the best out of everything I use when it comes to technology. The monitor sets up VERY easy. It has a CD that has the drivers on it and a setup program. The program is run from the CD and the software setup is the usual installation type info boxes seen in most software installations. The OS required me to reboot two times to sync the monitor and load the driver correctly. After that the monitor came up in the exact 1 2 configuration I wanted. If I wanted to move the monitor to the left side I could have changed the 1 2 display to reverse too. It is at 1600x900 resolution with vivid colors (250,000+ colors at 18-bit). No wash out, no distortion, and no fuzziness. What happens with the color differences is that many people run the 1st monitor at 1920x1080 (or higher with a higher color bit rate) while running the AOC at the lower 1600x900 (with a lower color bit rate). The colors will look a little different then. I now run both screens at 1600x900 for a nice match up. 1600x900 is pretty decent and I am very happy with that resolution. After all this is a notebook and I am not going for high resolution."},

I have three monitors at 24inches, all different brands. This is by far the best one. The best display and the best set of options for input and output ports. Believe it or not most monitors don't come with hdmi slots, I have no idea why but they don't. I guess the companies feel it is cheaper not to have them. Problem is hdmi is what everything is transitioning to so if you only have dvi and vga, you most likely will need a converter. The converters tend to cause issues as well. Not only that VGA and DVI ports are way more likely to break. This is what happened to my Acer of the same size, both of the ports stopped working so you're pretty much out of luck. This monitor also has a an audio output slot which is very very useful. I use it when I play PS4 by putting in USB charged speakers to the PS4 while the audio cord is plugged into the monitor. If you need some speakers to go with these get these, AmazonBasics USB Powered Computer Speakers (A100). They do well with this monitor and are only 14 bucks. The ASUS also blows the other two's lighting and picture out of this world. I had all three of them going at the same time and you can clearly see the ASUS has way better picture quality. Not even close. So the fact that this monitor is about 30 bucks more than the cheapest 24 inch monitors, buying this is way worth it in my opinion.

My only complaints about this monitor is that it came with a VGA cable, rather than a DVI or HDMI cable (VGA won't cause any problems, but it bothered me. I had another DVI cable lying around so I'm using that), and that the base sticks out 3.5 inches in front of the panel, making it difficult to position on my desk.

This worked great on my computers (various laptops and desktops).  Most of my computers were using Windows 8 or older.  The features of the USB monitor worked as discribed by the manufacturer.  The main benefit was being able to travel with a 2nd monitor with my laptop for business trips.  The provided case is fairly soft which keeps the AOC clean and free from scratches; however, you probably want to pack accordingly to protect the AOC from damaging events.  Also you should disconnect the USB cable when travelling to avoid breaking the USB3 port on the monitor."},

The higher resolution is great and the image quality is significantly better. I keep the monitor in the trunk so I always have a second screen when I'm travelling. It is very light - partly to to the lack of an AC adapter - and pretty compact. For the life of me I don't understand how anyone could live with just one screen. I have to admit that I sometimes consider travelling with a USB hub so I could use both the old monitor and this one but that may be carrying things too far."},

It was very frustrating and annoying and would happen once every 10 minutes at least. I reached out to AOC customer support and they said it could be the USB cord. Cord came and still had same issues. I then had to pay $99 for a new one to be shipped out (they did pay for the return shipping). Once I received it, I would ship back the broken one and get my $99 refunded. Well, the \"new\" replacement monitor came and was already broken! The screen looked cracked so I called them and they shipped out ANOTHER replacement monitor. Meanwhile, I sent back the 2nd broken monitor that arrived. Waited for my 3rd new replacement monitor. This one showed up and had some issues still (would be plugged it and it would be a black screen and have an icon telling me to plug it into the monitor). Would also do the same flickering, but it was once a day instead of once every 10 minutes. I figured I would just deal with it to avoid the hassle of returning it. So this morning, I wake up and it looks like the attached pictures. I emailed AOC and they said that it looks like it was damaged, etc. and that isn't covered by their warranty. I haven't even traveled or moved this monitor once since I've had the replacement. Not to mention, the monitor is lightweight and really isn't very protected. I could see how traveling with this monitor could easily cause it to have damage. I would suggest getting a warranty that provides damage protection as AOC could care less. I need to purchase a 2nd monitor now again after wasting all of my time and $100 and I am looking to go with another brand if anyone has any suggestions. I usually do not write product reviews, but I am not happy with AOC or this purchase."},

The DisplayLink drivers also remember the display configuration - when I'm at my desk using the AOC as a 3rd monitor, I have it in landscape mode, and when I'm undocked and using the built-in display, it remembers that I like to use the monitor rotated 270degrees so I can use it in portrait mode - very clever.

Unfortunately, the difference between them couldn't be more apparent. While the screen size is the same, the border is much wider on the new one which makes it seem larger. When I first plugged it in and had the computer recognize the dual screen, it was obvious that the colors were way off. The yellow tint that other reviewers have complained about was there. I used the monitors' menu settings to get them as close as possible but there is so much bleed-through from the backlight that the new one is still brighter and the blacks are not as deep as the older one. I did notice the next day that the yellow tint had vanished so I don't know what that was all about. I'm not a perfectionist so I'm not going to go through the trouble of boxing the thing up and sending it back just because the blacks aren't a true black.

The bottom bar does protrude so if you\u2019re planning to use a dual screen set-up, keep that in mind because it will leave a gap but very small. Some people in the reviews will often complain about a fade or burn in their screens but can be easily fixed by disabling the OD setting to OFF in the settings menu.

The picture quality is fairly good.  The biggest drawback is that the driver does not add any controls, so there is no way to adjust the brightness and only minimal control over anything else.  Sometimes it errors in funny ways - such as a window not showing up quite right, or the background bleeding through the foreground window.  But in general, this goes away if I move the windows slightly.  I \"solved\" the brightness issue by simply turning the screen away from me when it is too bright for my surroundings.

He said there is a KNOWN compatibility problem with Surface  Book because it does not give off enough power.  I was confused because the first monitor worked fine ... until the bleed.  He told me that not every monitor is made the same in the manufacturing process and some require more power.  I said that there's a second USB which comes with the unit which is supposed to be for less powerful laptops and that I tried it and it didn't work.  He said that the second USB is not made for Surface Books.  Because of what he said, I decided to try one more time and get another monitor to see if it was one of the ones that requires less power.

It is nothing like my laptop screen, this reminds me of a screen maybe from the 90s.  Because of the distortion and what looks like polarization/distortion when I move my head even an inch from the optimal viewing angle which honestly there is no optimal viewing angle with this screen.  Waste of time, will most likely be re-packaging and sending back to Amazon.  The kickstand and portability is the only redeeming features.

He needed a monitor for his security system as his old one was beginning to fail on him. As a early Christmas gift I decided to order him one through Amazon and chose an Asus monitor. My laptop is an Asus and it has been an excellent, trouble-free computer. My brother tells me this monitor was easy to connect as a replacement to his old one. Asus had provided two cables which came as a surprise to us both since most electronics often come without the much needed assessories. I was told the picture and sound was crystal clear and I could hear how pleased my brother was from the tone of his voice. That brought a smile to my face because when I give a gift, sight unseen, and it turns out to be the perfect gift....well that is worth everything to me."},

I use it for web-browsing and can always read everything clearly, video/series/movie watching and can see everything (including film grain and subtle digital noise) clearly, editing video and can see every detail I need to (including accurate colors) and gaming and can spot everything important as soon as it's visible. Nothing about the visual quality and accuracy of this monitor is sub-par is any way. The only thing that's wrong with this device as a whole is every audio feature. The speakers are worthless and the audio that comes through the 3.5mm jack on the back sounds awful (no bass, distant). Sure, it's bearable if you need speakers in a pinch, but if you're considering it for any use besides that of a visual nature, skip it. I'm not subtracting any stars because it's nearly perfect in every other way."},

I was stuck between this ASUS monitor and a HP one and I ultimately chose this one. So I read a lot of review that the color is off and whatnot, which I can agree with, there is a slight difference between the monitor and my laptop but i dont really care as much as other, I mainly go this monitor to help with multitasking and studying. Im and engineering student and sometimes homework is a bit troublesome with only one display and of course I wanted a larger screen to game with. I have the monitor hooked with the HDMI connection and so far I think this is a great monitor, I think that the color contrast is better than my laptop. Ive played Fall out 4 on it and the refresh rate is fast enough to keep up with the game. The only thing that Im slightly pissy about is with the seller. When I first looked at this monitor it was only $109 then 2 hours later when i was ready to make the purchase, the price was increased to $119 and now a week later, the price is $147. Im attempting to do the $20 dollar mail in rebate but the ASUS company doesnt make it easy on you, you have to sign a form, give a copy of the invoice, and original UPS and serial number bar codes off the box. There is no option to submit online, you have to mail the rebate in. So if the rebate comes back, that means I got this monitor for $99, which in my opinion is a great deal for a newer lcd monitor with an hdmi hook up."},

If I attempt to move a document from the AOC screen, block text to move, or try to move the document over slightly the screen will turn black.  It sometimes comes back up after 30 or more seconds and other times it does not and I have to unplug the monitor from the laptop and plug it back in again to work.

I'm an IT person, so tried troubleshooting with different drivers and OSs on 4 different systems, but no luck. So only 1 out of  4 lasted more than 8 months and two didn't last more than 6 months.

The picture quality is incredibly sharp and does not seem to suffer much, if at all, from the anti-glare coating. The only real adjustment that I had to make was brightness. At the default brightness setting of 100, it can be difficult to look at the display for more than a half hour before taking a break. For sustained use, a brightness setting between 30-40 is much more comfortable, and will provide a brightness that is close to the widely preferred 120 cd/m\u00b2. Since this is a small-moderate sized monitor at 23 inches, the pixel density is fine enough (95.78 PPI, 0.2652 mm dot pitch) to not see individual pixels at a normal viewing distance (~3 feet).

But seriously, half of the screen cracked and the whole frame came off which made it break into 3 pieces - back circuit boards exposed, led screen and frame."},

Both laptops cannot reboot when the hdmi is connected to the Asus monitor. Both laptops can reboot when connected to the Samsung monitor. I then called Asus tech support and the tech had me go through his list of trouble shooting to no avail. Finally, the tech did some internet searches and came back and said it was an Intel HD Graphics 3000 problem and not the Asus monitor. He refused to help any further.

Since using this for a month or so, I have had at least a half dozen friends purchase one too. No complaints from anyone. I have also had a couple of other friends opt for a more expensive model that gives a higher resolution as the Optimum Resolution for this unit is only 1366 x 768 @60Hz. For me 1366 x 768 is perfect for internet browsing, twitter, email, or even working in the MS Office Suite. For anything that required a super high resolution I would use my primary display. If you use this for what it is for, a travel companion to expand your desktop to, you will love it.

This caused resolution issues with the HDMI port not being able to display the monitor's native 1920x1080 resolution and bumped it down to 1024x728. Unfortunately, there is no fix for the resolution issue since there isn't any drivers for this particular model of monitor, and no bypass.

For instance, when I open a browser, the web page automatically appears on this 17\" AOC display, whereas with the 16\" one, I have to drag the page there, and the drag itself is quite troublesome, often jumping back by itself. Also, the 17\" one is truly plug and play, hitting the ground running immediately when plugged into Surface Pro 4, even for the 1st time. While the 16\" can also plug and play, it has encountered problems, which were only resolved after I installed the driver from the included disk (I have to buy an external disk player for that purpose, for Surface Pro doesn't have a DVD drive). The picture quality on both displays are very good to my eyes, even though not as good as Surface Pro 4.  The only improvement I wish AOC to make is to make a groove around the back to store the cable flush, while fixing the proprietary end of the cable on the display (no point removing it if it can be stored flush on the back)."},

I wanted a monitor that I could move around with out much fuss (cables and ac adapter). I love how this monitor uses only 1 USB port. I was skeptical but when I first tried the monitor but it turned right on after I downloaded the drivers from AOC support website and installed those drivers. After that it was just plug in the monitor into an open USB port and use it! It doesn't have an on/off switch but one is not needed, just unplug the USB cable. I did not notice any lag (some reviews said there was a lag) while using the monitor all day and I only have USB 2.0. The monitor doesn't weight much and right now I have it up against my 14\" monitor on my laptop and that was I can still use my laptop keyboard and mouse. So it's like my 14\" laptop now has a 17.3\" screen! Also, I am using it as my one and only screen. You can set it up with dual screen but the size of this I only need to use this monitor. Also, if you turn the monitor portrait it will automatically turn your windows display (like most cell phones do now). I am using Windows 7 Professional."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Very good; room for improvement", "review_body": "This is not a perfect monitor, but it is really a great option for having a second monitor while travelling.  It is true that it does not have a wide angle of view -- really, it's quite narrow.  But it's certainly better than having no external monitor at all while on the road.  For me, the set-up went smoothly; the auto-rotate works great; and the monitor is thin and light for easy portability.  I use this with a Surface Pro 3.  When plugged in, SP3 will power this monitor though a USB3 connection.  However, when the SP3 is itself running on its battery, it will not power this monitor through the USB3 port alone.  However, it will do so if you connect the power prong of the AOC monitor's USB3 Y cable  to an external battery.  So, this monitor is fully usable with a SP3 even when you need to be unplugged because there is no AC power source available.  As for room for improvement, I'd like the monitor to have a higher pixel density.  More importantly, I'd like AOC, or someone, to make one of these USB monitors with a 3:2 aspect ratio, instead of the 16:9 that it has, like the Surface Pro 3 and 4, and like the many clones of the Surface line that other computer manufacturers are now putting out."},

First, the monitor bezel is much larger than the VN-series, roughly two to three times as thick. This is very noticeable in a side-by-side configuration, particularly since the VN-series has such a thin bezel. Second, the monitor is brighter than the VN-series when looking at the exact same image, but the contrast is significantly worse. Black is much more gray on this monitor. The final major difference is that the cables plug straight back into the monitor, where on the VN-series they are down, allowing for much less rear clearance. Since this is not my primary monitor, I am happy using it next to the VN-series, and by itself it would look perfectly fine, but in a direct side-by-side comparison there is a reason that I had paid more for the VN-series monitor and I wish my local electronics store had still carried them. When being driven by exactly the same video card using digital outputs, I prefer the slightly dimmer VN-series with a better perceived contrast ratio.

Bought this as a \"second\" screen to go with my excellent Asus ProArt 24\" which is as good as I've ever seen. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for and I couldn't come close to matching the colors between the 2 Asus models. No matter what I tried, the VS228 always had a yellow tint to it (defect?) so I returned it and now I'm going to try another, less expensive Asus, the PB238Q which is an IPS, so maybe I can get an affordable \"second\" monitor that will come close to matching the ProArt. If not, I guess I'll have to break the bank and get another ProArt. If I didn't have the ProArt to compare this to, I would give it 4 stars as the images are fairly bright and sharp, and for price/value 5 stars. But it just looks VERY inferior next to the ProArt."},

I don't quite understand why Asus produces current monitors that DO require that.  I also have their 25 inch M250 which has a blue lit tonal adaptor in its color display that eliminates the faint yellowish cast this one still has.  Which again surprises me when this is a newer Asus model.  Both are gorgeous displays, with easy and extensive menu features to adjust to closer to my tastes, but I'm still more fond of the bluish cast to the older model.  Please note it's only a temperature hint of blue, just enough to eliminate the yellow.  Think of sunglass lenses that have the blue gray finish versus the brown finish, and you may better understand what I mean.  My third monitor is going to be another one of the M250's.

The VS239H-P is a nice 1080p60 IPS display with a decent price. The monitor stand is noticeably wobbly, and there are no VESA mounting options built in, but these are things I can easily overlook. I have not been able to notice any major ghosting issues while gaming, and I am not an expert when it comes to color accuracy. However, it is a very worthy upgrade over the old 1440x900 TN panel I used before purchasing this. The built in 3.5mm audio out is a nice touch for systems which do not already have one available (Alienware Alpha comes to mind). There have been no dead pixels or noticeable light bleed with my specific monitor after almost a year of use. Definitely recommended."},

I bought this monitor to use when I am on the road with my second laptop that I bought for work/travel.  Before I tried to use the monitor for the first time, I ran the driver installation program on the CD Rom disk that was included with the monitor as per the instructions.  Big mistake.  I knew going into the purchase that Windows 10 was a little iffy with this product, but I thought I would take a gamble since the price was reasonable and other users said they were able to get it to work.  After running the install, I plugged the monitor into my computer and the screen flashed the AOC logo and my computer made the device connected beep, then nothing.  When I went to the display settings and clicked the detect additional display button and the computer couldn't detect the device. I tried all of the USB ports with the same result.  I even tried running the uninstall driver option on the driver disk setup program and restarted the computer and had no luck, as well as trying help suggestions I found on several message boards.  I was about ready to give up and return the product, but thought I would test the monitor on a couple of other computers.  I tried it on my computer at work that runs windows 10 and it worked within a few seconds of plugging it in with no driver install.  I tried it on my home computer that also runs windows 10, which is also an HP laptop like my travel laptop, and it worked perfectly.  As a last ditch attempt, I decided to try the radical approach and do a system restore to a date before I had run the driver install program on the cd rom.  Sure enough, after the system restore completed and the computer rebooted, I plugged the monitor into one of the USB ports and the monitor worked perfectly.  So, for now I will give it 4 stars just because of the aggravation caused by the driver cd.  Otherwise, if the monitor continues to work, then I would say it does what is supposed to do for a pretty reasonable price.  Also, it comes with a neoprene travel case, which is a nice add-on."},

Its viewing angles are supriaingly good and its colors are pretty vibrant (don't use game mode, turn on demo mode and then turn it off and it will save with more vibrant colors) with pretty good blacks. It gets very bright (I usually keep mind around 70). The stand is flimsy and your monitor will shake if you move your desk but its easily removable and it does come with a vesa mount so props Asus. For fps it does a fine job with its 2ms gtg time though I don't know what the actual input lag is. If you're a pro gamer, keep looking but casual gamers its a nice  monitor. It feels very responsive and it doesn't hurt the eyes after 8+ hours of continuous use (tested). I now have to replace it because I raged during csgo and I threw my hyperx clouds at it and it cracked the LCD itself so there's a few lines running through it horizontally and vertically though I can still game just fine in fps's."},

My secretary can have two or three windows open simultaneously and see what she needs or can have one window open wide enough that lateral scrolling isn't necessary. Also tall enough to see much more of web pages, text documents, etc without having to scroll as much. I believe it tilts to adjust it to your or your desk height. It has a reasonable footprint, too.

The picture quality is terrific for my purposes, I can;t see a difference between my laptop screen or this AOC monitor. I have a 6 year old Dell Core i5 with discrete video card, nothing special.  Plugged into the one USB 3.0 port, and was up and running in ~two minutes, time it took my computer to load drivers directly from the monitor.  I do a lot of search/copy/paste work for my job, searching raw data documents (mostly Word, .pdf, e-mails, and internet sources), and copying and pasting or paraphrasing to my document.  This second monitor makes life SO much easier.  I LOVE how compact it is---I have a very small work space, and only have room for a small monitor like this.  I also  love that it is totally USB powered, so I don't have another power cord cluttering up my work space.  The soft cover is fine.  It's nothing fancy, just fine gauge ballistic, but lightly padded to soften jolts, and keeps the screen from getting scratched when packed.  It weighs I think 2.4 lbs, which is nothing.  The swivel back rest stand is well designed, and I think very effective.  I would ordinarily not have bought a  brand that I had never heard of before like AOC, but this company really executed their product to my satisfaction.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.

I was worried when I first hooked it up because it only has HDMI and DisplayPort and VGA connections on the back, but it came with a DVI to HDMI cable so I used that.  And then I noticed that the picture didn't nearly fill the screen to the edges, nor was it sharp at all but instead was fuzzy.  So it had this big black border all around it.  I did some Googling and it turns out the problem is with my video card driver.  I have an AMD Radeon so I used the AMD Catalyst Control Center software and went to the settings for \"Overscaling\", or \"Scaling Options (Digital Flat-Panel)\".  This article was very very helpful: http://www.7tutorials.com/fix-hd-flat-monitors-and-amdati-cards-not-displaying-full-screen-image .

This is a nicely styled device that is more or less ideal for my needs. I did not have a plug 'n play experience though. I previously had installed a 16\" monitor using a SIIG USB3 to VGA adapter since my PC does not have VGA. After uninstallation, it left behind a component that is not compatible with Displaylink. The Displaylink web site described how to resolve the problem. I previously had a 9\" DoubleSight USB monitor and that set my expectations low for USB monitors. That AOC is not bright compared to AC/DC monitors, viewing angle is limited, colors look washed out. Brightness is my main complaint but I guess there is only so much power that a USB3 port can provide. I could see where people who want a portable, second monitor could find this a very attractive option and judging from the nice, included neoprene carrying case, that is AOC's target customer. It does what I need it to do. I would prefer an AC/DC version with better brightness (small monitors are scarce now!). Bottom line: do not expect this to perform at the level of today's AC/DC monitors, otherwise it is perhaps the best of a small pack."},

I'm not currently gaming on this device so I can't tell you of there's any motion blur, etc.  However I will tell you that I can see color I didn't see before in my old monitor (for example, subtle shading differences between rows in a table, and things like that).  As other reviewers have stated, it comes out of the box optimized for showrooms, so it's bright.  If you have a brightly lit room, as I do, that will work fine.

The one comment that gave me pause before purchasing was by an individual who felt that the \"industry standard\" regarding number of \"dead\" pixels was unacceptable (standard five or less \"dead\" pixels is an industry standard). I went ahead and purchased the monitor. Right out of the box, there were two (2) \"dead\" pixels on the screen. Now this might seem small and most users would probably never notice the missing pixels, but it so happens I work with 3D models. And guess what, the \"dead\" or \"missing\" pixels are right in the middle of my work area! Lucky me!!! Well, I've learned to live with them (the \"dead\" pixels) so far, but they are an annoyance! There are some simple utilities available on line that may or may not correct the \"dead\" pixels, currently I have not tried any of them. So I'm giving this monitor three stars only which I think is generous. Beyond the pixel issue, the color and clarity is very good. There are some occasional \"flickering\" issues but not to the detriment of my projects."},

This REALLY sucks, because the audio out was one of the main reasons I purchased this monitor. Of course, if you're just planning to use it with your computer, you can hook your speakers to that.

Great thing I did, because the meeting room with the overhead was unavailable last minute, and we instead had to sit around a table.

When purchasing electronics I do think that one has to manage expectations, and for the price you can't get any better. I do think it could be a bit brighter, but this is only a minor flaw. Also, take note that you can't adjust the stand so if you need the monitor to be higher you will need to add a monitor stand which also adds to the cost. Also the bezels are thin, so it makes it easy to buy two for a dual monitor setup. I haven't checked for light bleed as the other reviewers, and to my eye the backlight is even. I do think that after using the monitor for a while the lightbleed shouldn't be a major deal, at least to me it isn't.

And it is a large widescreen format. Great value monitor with crisp, high resolution. If you look at the other reviews out there on the bottom-end of the scale people have had issues. I was skeptical but based on the high number of positive reviews took a chance. You have to play with the brightness and contrast settings to set the picture right for you (don't listen to all the brightness \"bleed\" comments - I think those people just don't know how to tweak the settings (I keep my brightness and contrast both at 55 and it looks great). The base isn't the strongest and it wobbles a little when you touch the monitor, but when it's just sitting there it is totally fine. FYI mine had no pixels out and 2 weeks later had a red pixel dot near the center of the screen for the day but has since disappeared - and I'm not sure if it was the monitor or the video card producing it. Either way the pixel is no longer out and it is an excellent picture. Highly recommend this product!"},

With all due respect to said reviewer, I don't know how accurate those statements are but I will say the monitor I received seems to be one of the good ones based on those clues. As far as function, it works beautifully. The display colors are vibrant and I see no pixel issues at all. I have only had it a few days and only time will tell how good this unit really is.

There is one gotcha though - if the brightness is not on 100% - the backlight flickers. This is because it uses Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) to control the brightness. Basically, the LED doesn't dim - instead it turns ON/OFF about 200 times a second with varying duration of the ON phase, to create an illusion of darker image. See for yourself - put brightness on 50% and wave pencil in front of the screen - you will see several pencils like in a stroboscope. This causes eyes fatigue and headaches in some people. Luckily there is a simple solution. Put brightness on 100% and reduce contrast setting to reduce brightness. Test with the pencil again - no stroboscope effect. This might distort the collors a little but it's much better than the headache. And for the price - I love it."},

I bought this monitor to replace an existing smaller ASUS VS238H-P.  After spending time dismounting the smaller monitor from a flexible arm mount and replacing it with the larger one, I found I could NOT attach the power chord since it was partially covered by the mounting bracket.  The SMALLER ASUS monitor had no such problem. . I soon discovered the  VESA  100 mounting holes on the back of the new larger monitor were not centered on the case.  They are 5 mm closer to the lower edge of the monitor.  How hard can it be to put the holes in the middle of the monitor case --or even somewhere NEAR the center?  I contacted ASUS customer service to inquire if this was a manufacturing defect or had they purposefully not adhered to the VESA standard.  All the representative  would ask me was if I had read the manual? The manual says nothing except that it has VESA mounts on the back.  What hurts even more is I have to PAY to ship it back. I generally like AUS and currently own 8-10 of the VS238s and am quite pleased with their performance.  The experience with this product was definitely not what I expected from ASUS"},

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Size is not what is pictured. Monitor stand is very short.", "review_body": "I went from a 27\" Dell LCD to the Asus because of price and I needed a monitor fast, after 6 years w/Dell (dead pixels.) I couldn't afford another Dell so after searching for a 24\" LED, I settled on the Asus. I made a huge mistake in buying this. First, the main photo in the description is deceptive. This monitor is not as wide as pictured. It is a square size monitor, not rectangular as shown. Color calibration is essential and it will take hours until you find your correct personal settings. Once calibrated (search online for free calibration) I found I could not stretch the screen, so I have approx. 1\" of black all around. I did not use the recommended resolution because I found I needed a magnifying glass to read the screen. I tried to stretch the screen but Windows 7 does not have that option although earlier versions of Win does. So, in essence instead of a 24\" screen, I have a 22\". Makes a world of difference if you are working with photos and vids as I do. Now, after calibrating, I went to a friend's new website and was asked if I liked the background color. All I saw was white. Went to my tablet, laptop and phone to check the background and the color was visible on those. Not sure if it is me or the monitor. The stand is very, very short and is only moveable forwards/backwards. I have it sitting on my desk with two thick books underneath the stand. I am 5'2\" and if I used the stand alone, I would be looking over the top of the monitor. Not sure why Asus does not make an adjustable screen as it certainly would be useful for visualization. As some reviewers have said, looking at the screen from any angle other than straight ahead is useless. I agree. Luckily this is a very lightweight (almost too lightweight) that I can lift and turn it when working with photos. Had I not needed a monitor in a pinch, I would have said some money and gotten a better monitor. For a basic, basic monitor it's okay. If you work with photos or do heavy editing, this is not for you. I'm lucky I have the laptop and tablet to turn to when needing close-ups or writing docs. Personally, it's my fault for rushing into purchasing this and plan to find out how to return it."},

I even began to suspect maybe THIS monitor has the TRUE colors and every other display I've used has the WRONG colors, but since buying this I really experimented and took note and this is the odd one out. None of the built in settings or adjustments really seem to address the flaws I see in the color reproduction. The brightness control controls the backlight and not the brightness of the picture, and the contrast control's range is very small.

My requirements were: LED, full HD 1920 x 1080, and VESA mountable.  My primary use is video editing, and I also do some PhotoShop, so I liked the idea of having IPS also, but that was not a primary requirement.  HDMI was also not a requirement for me but would be nice to have.  I read numerous reviews and considered a couple of other models/brands (ViewSonic and LG in IPS displays).  For the price, the features, the overall good reviews, and Asus name (I have one of their laptops and one motherboard, love them both), I decided to get 2 of these.  I LOVE THEM!  The color is fantastic, the detail is amazing, the screen is very bright (had to turn it down a bit), and it's nice and BIG!  Editing videos with Pinnacle Studio 16 was such a delight on these - details are sharp and clear.  Photos look amazing on them.  NO dead pixels and side-by-side they look perfectly matched (no difference in brightness/color/contrast).  I see no edge bleed and my Windows 7 desktop is a plain back screen...well, it was for a while until I saw how beautiful photos looked as the background, so now I have photo backgrounds.  It's just such a pleasure to look at.  IPS works as advertised, these have a very wide viewing angle (at least very wide to me compared to my last Hanns-G models).  I use the DVI and VGA ports but have not tested the HDMI port yet.  I also don't use the speakers so I can't say how they are (kinda pointless to me to use them when you can get so much better sound from a speaker system, even a cheap one).  I would HIGHLY recommend these monitors."},

The stand is pretty high quality and the screen in very thin. On first boot they were bright and decently colorful. Not as good as my old one, but for the price not bad. I soon noticed that the color was not the same on all monitors. one of them had slightly less bright whites, and one had whites with a slight tint of yellow. This was mostly fixed with some adjusting in the settings. So far these issues are easy to look over since they look so nice and nothing beats having three identical monitors. However they are not that great for the one reason I bought them for: Gaming. These monitors have SERIOUS image ghosting. If you don't know what this is, its when the pixels leave a shadow behinds moving images on the screen because they cant change color fast enough. This adds very noticeable white and black shadows in every game even the desktop. Coming from a higher quality (now discontinued monitor) these do not perform very well in that regard. The pixels are very slow. Even textures with little contrast get blurred when moving forward."},

It worked out of the box with my Dell XPS 13 laptop (running Windows 8.1 Pro) using the included USB 3.0 cable. But it didn't take long for a fatal flaw to surface... The cable sits rather loosely in the back of the monitor and the angle isn't ideal with the movement of the stand.

The set-up instructions on both a printed piece of paper and on a disc are a joke with virtually no helpful information. I had enough sense run the program that installed a PC driver but it took a long time to finish. I was planning to use this as a 3rd monitor....but to my surprise it killed my second monitor connection totally. It just became a black screen. A visit to my control panel was unable to restore it. The image quality on the USB monitor is as others have remarked....poor for anything but documents and printed matter. You can only view the monitor if viewed directly in front of it...any deviation and it disappears or distorts. To restore my PC I had to use the device manager to delete two display drivers installed from the disc. On top of all this, I found that no drivers are available at all for older Mac and PC operating systems. Check before you buy. Sending this product back."},

Still I highly recommend these very affordable monitors.  Fast refresh, great form factor, etc.  I do notice a bit of difference (some vignetting in the older of the two running now) & in brightness of whites.  However, I've always used a color calibration tool to get them to match so it is easy to get the old and new monitor to match.  This issue isn't likely that noticeable for most users, but in my case I do a fair amount of content creation and need color matching between monitors.  This usually pushes content creators toward higher end monitors, but as an avid gamer I wanted the high refresh rate as well.  As long as I take the time to calibrate the monitors (I use an old Spyder3), I find these are a good compromise for my needs.  This set up works well enough that i didn't hesitate to purchase another one when the oldest one died."},

The screw holes in the back are covered with little rubber pieces so that the back still looks flush and you don't see them unless you're using them for mounting. The monitor has very easy to understand controls in a convenient location (bottom right) to control things like power, brightness, etc and a little blue light indicating whether it is on, off, or it turns orange if in standby mode.

The colors and contrast are very good, and especially good for the price of the monitor. It's also very durable, and I've had absolutely no problems with this monitor so far. Having multiple inputs is great for anyone with a PC and gaming console (I have my PC hooked up with a DVI-D cable, and my PS3 is connected with an HDMI cable), or any other device. It's nice not having to switch cables with multiple devices anymore. The monitor also tilts nicely, and is easy to turn on it's base (the screen itself doesn't move separately of the base, but the base is very easy to move on a smooth surface), yet stable and reliably stationary.

One thing that I really like the most besides the picture is that for adjustments is that they actually have a proper number of buttons and the menu is initiative so no need to pop open a manual. The viewing angles are solid and just as good as my more expensive Samsung. The bases are solid, but I would feel better if they were a touch heavier and wider and if the little lock in tab was more noticeable as I assembled both without it getting locked in and had to take them back apart, which took all of 30 seconds. I use them for work, with lots of Excel and number crunching and looked at them for about 10 hours straight with no eyestrain. I will be looking into their bigger brothers when I go to upgrade the monitor on my gaming rig. The only other thing that I would prefer and besides the bases why I am knocking a star off is that the connectors come straight off the back instead of pointing down so if you are thinking about wall mounting or pushing them as close to a wall as you can you may want to consider that."},

In just a few words, the AOCs color looks like total crap. They've injected the monitor with a lot of excess blue to make it appear sharper and more vibrant. Television manufacturers do this to try to get in edge on competition while on-display in the store. The difference is that with TVs and non-DisplayLink monitors you can neutralize those artificial colors after you buy them. Not so here. This monitor cannot be calibrated, nor can you truly adjust the brightness (you can download programs that overlay some grey on your screen to mimic lowering the brightness). SO. If you have the option of a non-usb powered monitor instead of this, go for it. If you need it to be USB for portability, it's pretty decent at getting the job done.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Works for me", "review_body": "I bought this monitor because in addition to being budget priced, it is one of the few with HDMI input as well as DVI.  For its overall quality the price point is spectacular; i.e., it is a really good low budget monitor, and on that count, faulting it for not having other bells and whistles is just being fatuous.  Resolution is supported from 640x480 to 1920x1080, which should satisfy anyone.  While there are only 4 inputs: HDMI, DVI, VGA, and headphone, the color is good, with a number of settings that allow you to adjust to taste, if not for total color purity, and it is bright with an unusually good viewing angle, not that that is terribly critical for a computer monitor.  Set up is trivial.  The stand may not be super strong, but is totally adequate for almost any desktop, allowing adequate tilt/pivot (at least for my purposes), plus you have standard screw receptacles if you want to use it for a wall mount multi-monitor configuration.  It is very light and very thin.  Note that it does not incorporate a USB hub, which I suppose might be a factor for some buyers.  One thing I particularly appreciate is that it uses a conventional power cord rather than the custom power supplies I've encountered with other monitors.  This just may be the best monitor value out there at this time and as such deserves a 5-star rating."},

There are six (6) different settings available for the \"Splendid\" mode, which offers a wide range of preset adjustments; I use Splendid often; I love this feature!  Speaker quality is OK considering they're monitor speakers; no real complaint here.  The only problem that should be noted is that when using the supplied DVI/HDMI Cable, the monitor looses sink when the computer is coming out of sleep mode.  The only way to get sink back is to re-plug the monitor or reboot, however, this doesn't happen with an HDMI/HDMI connection.  Since the computer I'm using this monitor with doesn't have an HDMI port, I rated it three (3) stars because of the inconvenience.  Overall though, this is a decent monitor."},

Connected with a older video card that supports dual monitors. (ATI Radeon 2400 PRO 256mb)  Text looks sharp and clear. The colors, contrast, brightness, etc. look exactly the same on both screens. AWESOME!! The first thing I did was to make sure I had all the latest drivers for my video card and also reset the monitors to factory settings. This was necessary considering the monitors were sold used. By the way, they still looked new without any signs of use. No dead pixels or anything else. I've never had any issues buying from Warehouse deals. I also have another ASUS 23\" monitor that's been in use for a few years. Still going strong. Love ASUS quality. I'm not a Pro photographer, but I'm impressed with the image quality these monitors produce. I'm sure I'll need to calibrate them but from what I've seen with some recent prints, they look good out of the box. Because of technology, the IPS feature has been made more affordable. If you do your research, these monitors may not be true IPS but they do the job very well for the price."},

I am careful with the USB cable that plugs into the monitor as I also read that it tends to flex at the port that is in the back where the stand folds out. I may add an adhesive clip where the stand comes out to keep the cable from flexing at the port. I love it and wish I had bought one sooner. Great picture and has not let me down yet."},

Also, I'm a serious amateur photographer, mainly of birds, and I find the color just fine. However, there are several choices of video mode: STANDARD, THEATER, GAME, NIGHT VIEW, sRBG, and SCENERY. To my eyes, STANDARD mode renders the colors and contrast best, especially with high definition photos, with sRBG a close second. The screen was a bit too bright for my eyes from the company, but that is easily remedied. Using the adjustment controls is fairly intuitive.

It worried me a tiny bit at first, but now it's just become something I'm used to. The second reason is more what takes away the star. Within 2-3 days of having the monitor, the headphone jack moved around or broke inside so that you can't plug anything in there anymore. Very disappointing from a brand I've grown to trust over the years. As for the headphone jack, I just use the one on my computer and am fine with that :)"},

The drivers/program that operates it is called displaylink, and it is quite honestly the most terrible software I have ever dealt with. It took me about 2 hours just to get the screen to be detected, apparently you have to download a displaylink full registry cleaner, run it. Then  leave the monitor disconnected while you install the drivers. Then reset the pc, then once it's back on, plug in the monitor and pray that it comes on and if not, repeat process.

It arrived on time and the monitor was still covered in the plastic that protects the bezel so it does look brand new. My only complaint is that the base comes in 2 pieces held together by one screw. When the monitor arrived, I noticed at the screw was missing so I couldn't put the base together to set the my monitor up on my desk. Though not really that big of a deal because I went to the local hardware store and got a Metric screw to replace for like $0.50, it was still pretty inconvenient of Amazon to ship me the monitor and forget the screw.

The computer and sub sit behind the monitor facing outwards so that all the wires are coiled between the three devices and the wall.

When I hook up my laptop (14 inch Latitude E6420) and they sit next to each other in dual display mode, it makes the laptop screen look like a dusty old oil painting by comparison.

These aren't the be-all, end-all of computer monitors, although they are very nice for the price. The colors are nicely represented (although there is still some color bleed in the darker color levels, mainly black, as is with most cheaper monitors) and can get very bright. They are very clear and both arrived with no dead or stuck pixels. I usually use one to play games and another to watch movies or tv shows at the same time and they work very well in that aspect. Games look great in 1080p on these monitors, and movies look great as well. I wouldn't expect 100% clarity or 100% accurate color representation but they work very well again, for the price I bought them at. The bezels are on the medium/larger size although I do like the style they give off. The stands do get dusty easily but are also very easy to clean off. They also take three or four seconds to wake up from sleep, but that doesn't bother me as I usually don't let my computer sleep very often.

These are fantastic for multiple column spreadsheets and are even pretty good at displaying 4 half screen documents or websites on the dual monitor setup. The negatives are adjustability related and entirely off set by the price. At least in my case. Connection for VGA, DVI and HDMI makes set up a snap."},

I found the stand to be sturdy. The bezels are pretty thin and I can't really notice them when playing games in eyefinity mode which is great. There is however one downside to these monitors as I've read in a few places, the \"white wash\" effect is really apparent. Whites are bright white and don't really show detail, so if your an intense gamer this could pose a problem. I don't mind too much seeing as these monitors are only $120-140 each."},

There were no dead pixels upon arrival, and the colors are bright. I do use photoshop a lot to edit pictures and stuff and can see everything clearly. Mainly, I play games. Diablo III, Skyrim, Dishonored, Borderlands 2, Black Ops II all look beautiful on this monitor. Everything looks crisp. I don't have any issues with response or lag. 24\" monitor is perfect for what I do everyday. As previous reviews have stated, the monitor can be shaky on the stand that is provided. However, if you have a solid desk that won't be constantly shaking upon every  movement then this isn't a problem AT ALL. I have a sturdy desk and my monitor doesn't move unless I accidently hit it while reaching around it. This is seriously worth the buy, and comparing to the monitors that my friends use, I think it's worth every penny."},

One thing though, that the colors are on the \"cool\" side, but you can adjust them to be warm, but i actually like the cool settings better. The input switching seems kinda crappy. When i had my dells, it auto switched from HDMI to DVI when i turned off my xbox, but these just go dark, so you have to manually switch back to DVI. I've been using these for a couple months now, and am really happy with them. The only downsides are no adjustable stand, and no usb on the monitors.. but hey.. i didn't buy these for those items, i bought it for having great resolution, and it has totally helped relieve eye strain.

I do a lot of autocad and revit drafting and I do not feel any eye fatigue after a long day of work.  I am very glad i went for the IPS panel.  My brother got some 24\" TN panels for a little cheaper and they do not even compare to these.  The viewing angle are incredible which is great when others are viewing the screen either standing or sitting from the side.

As for resolution and so forth-great!  It could use some kind of adjustable up and down but for the price point, is ok.

The first thing that made me happy was the vibrant color and the details in pics, movies, and games.I watched Avatar Blu Ray and was really taken aback by how much sharper everything looked. Resident Evil 5 and Doom 3 are fast moving games and they looked great. The sharp pictures and color along with the clear black on white text is kind of similar to the quality on my dads $1,000 dollar Mac panel. I know that sounds hard to believe, but its true. Now for the cons. It has a little back light bleed on the bottom of the panel. Its only noticeable at certain times, 98% of the time its not even there. The second issue is viewing angles. At certain angles from the side of the monitor it will get cloudy and lose its definition. It has some slight viewing angle issues. It might have some settings that can fix that, but its not a real big deal to me when considering the price. I really don't want to spend hundreds more on a monitor so I can view it from every conceivable viewing angle. The third thing that could have been better was the stand. The stand is a bit flimsy as other have stated, but its not an extreme issue if your desk is solid and stable. I'm coming from a Dell '17 digital flat panel and I'm seeing much brighter whites and better blacks without any pixelation or distortion. The price point and features of this monitor made it a excellent buy for me."},

Since this monitor is used for pure word processing, I never even add any speaker to the whole computer unit at all. So it is my first time to hear it makes any sounds, some strange songs I have never heard before. I then played a random online video, no sound. Plugged my earphone into the desktop, no sound. Plugged my earphone into the monitor, strange music again, which is totally independent from the video I was playing and showing on the monitor!

I'm willing to bet that a lot more of these monitors are tilted, but most people just haven't noticed because they're not very attentive to detail.

Don't care for the glossy bezel but I do like the matte finish screen which is great and colorful.  Took some playing around to get the screen looking the way I want in terms of color, contrast, etc.  I have standard mode on and used the built in OS X Display Calibration to tweak to my liking.  I still don't like the way fonts look on this monitor - I am open to suggestions on how to make them look better.  The monitor wobbles despite firmly screwing in the base but I can live with it - you can always buy a vesa mount.  Even better deal with $20 mail in rebate before end of August 2013!  Am thinking of getting a second one.  All the positive reviews are true on this one.

Go for the extra 30 bucks and buy this one even if you only have usb 2.0; this one is much more portable.  Only problem for me is I can't get it working on my Linux laptop, so for that  I bought the Gechic one-lap which is powered through by usb but sends data through a regular hdmi or vga connection.  The gechic is much harder to view.  In portrait mode its almost impossible to find a viewing angle from which none of the dark parts of the screen image appear as a slight negative image.  Black text on a white background comes out ok, but large dark areas have a weird, negative-like quality which gets dramatically worse when viewed from an oblique angle.

To make matters worse, when I tried to find the customer service number, I clicked on the link for US service and was taken repeatedly to a blank page or error page (regardless of which browser I used). The problem I had with the ASUS was that I could not get the correct screen resolution - everything was distorted. There were no driver disks included and my computer (Dell Dimension E310 - yes, I know, it's old) only recognized the monitor as a generic monitor.

A side note, related to the DisplayLink drivers required for this monitor and virtually all USB monitors, SLI will not work while this monitor is plugged into your system. There is a driver conflict which causes issues during full screen gaming on your Non USB monitor. DisplayLink has been aware of this for years and cares not to address it."},

It does come with a neoprene sleeve so if you were going to buy an additional case like I did, you don't need to.

Even if there were any dead pixels, you cannot blame Asus as the standard for LCD manufacturers is 3 or less dead pixels per monitor.

I did notice that up close the pixels are a tiny bit noticeable but that could also be my very sensitive eyes for that sort of thing. the colors looked pretty vivid and where not over saturated. Also the viewing angles are pretty good. I eventually got a new computer and hooked it up alongside my Xbox and it says in the description that you need a VGA to DVI cable that is included to run DVI. Mine came with a DVI cable instead so I plugged in my computer and it works using the DVI cable plugged into the DVI port so the description is slighly wrong. also I found the volume in the settings but nothing comes out which could just be that Im using an Xbox or there may be no internal Speakers.

The ASUS has a higher resolution than my existing monitor and side by side the difference was noticeable but not significant. I backed down the resolution of the ASUS a couple of notches to equal the other one and the border disappeared. This is acceptable to me.

So far the monitor has not disappointed. It offers a big screen, great visuals, and a fast response time all for under $150. Being so cheap, the monitor does sacrifice some features such as certain connectivity options and physical adjustment ability. However, if mostly what you're looking for in a monitor is great image and don't have hundreds of dollars to splurge on a top-end model, then I highly recommend this one."},

The only trouble I had was more of an operator error than anything, but apparently there are some presets on the monitor which can cause the gamma to bottom out during certain display times, particularly when the lighting of the game, movie, what have you, is low, such as caves or dark menu screens and so forth. I'm not sure if this is the monitor alone or the way it interfaces with certain video cards. Either way, you can customize the settings on the monitor or pick a different preset and the issue goes away. Given that I'm not losing any utility at all in light of that, still definitely a 5-star worthy monitor."},

First, the picture how it comes is washed out and faded. I was extremely disappointed at first, but once I changed the settings, it's gorgeous. I prefer a glossy screen, which this isn't, but for the huge price difference it's a very worthwhile sacrifice. One very large quirk of the screen itself is it's astounding ability to hold onto finger prints, no matter how hard you try to get them off. It can take a lot of effort (don't push too hard, or you may damage it!), but eventually, the marks will come off. I'd still recommend never touching it, and leaving it out of the reach of small children who don't know better. The build quality of the display itself is excellent, but the stand leaves much to be desired. That's not to say it won't last or doesn't serve it's purpose, but it can be VERY wobbly. If you're sitting still, it's not a problem, but otherwise it can be very obvious (when sitting down at your desk or changing position, for example). For the price, however, it's very much worth the money, and I'd absolutely (and am planning on) buy it again."},

It only tilts back and forth, and only a limited distance, but that is sufficient for my needs.  It did seem to have one dead/faulty pixel on arrival, but I didn't feel like that was enough to return it and get a new screen.  The pixel may not have been dead, only faulty since it seems to have fixed itself after a few weeks of use.  I have the monitor for at least half the day usually when I am working from home, so it gets pretty good use - probably 4-5 hours at least everyday.

It's also fairly wobbly & shaky at the slightest movement, but it's ok for me as my work surface is typically pretty steady.  The 3 inputs on the back are nice (VGA, DVI & HDMI).  Finally, it's the wide 16:9 or 16:10 aspect ratio (I can't recall which) makes it seem a little smaller than the 23.6\" it actually is, and doesn't really feel any bigger than the 21.5\" it replaced."},

Great monitor for the price; there are higher end monitors but they also come at higher end prices.  I have to say I prefer this monitor to the Apple display.  The Apple Display was infinitely sturdier and better constructed, but frustratingly few settings (on/off and slight brightness adjustment - that was it).  The ASUS VS239H-P gives you an incredibly wide variety of settings, and with some tinkering you will be able to get the perfect settings for whatever you need to do.  Comes with VGA, DVI, and HDMI inputs.  The main complaint from everyone is that the display stand is a bit wobbly, and it is, but treat yourself to a work desk that isn't from IKEA and it won't be an issue.  When attached to the stand, the monitor does sit low, (3 & 1/2\" from the stand base to bottom of screen) but I stacked some books under it and now it's not a problem.  (Since you are dying to know, those books are \"Hitchcock's Films Revisited\", \"Writing for Short Film\", and \"Roots.\")  If your desk isn't a cluttered disaster like mine this might not be an issue for you, but I need my monitor to lord high above my plastic Nintendo figurines.

A second reason for deleting one star is the extremely poor Asus documentation that came with the monitor.  It is in about 14 different languages, in very small font, and not well organized.

I am plugging all of my arcade components into a single power strip so that everything can be turned on and off simultaneously via the power strip rocker switch.  The \"brain\" of my arcade is a Raspberry Pi (running PiMAME) which uses HDMI for video.  The problem I have encountered is that when I power on the monitor and the Raspberry Pi simultaneously via the power strip, the HDMI input on the monitor does not seem to respond quickly enough.  A short time after power-on, the monitor reports no HDMI signal found and meanwhile the Raspberry Pi comes up with no video output. I tried another HDMI cable to be sure that wasn't the culprit but same result. I then switched to using the DVI port on the monitor, together with a DVI-HDMI dongle and this works fine i.e. the monitor's DVI signalling seems to respond much faster and I immediately see the boot messages from the Pi."},

For price of this monitor you get a deal and picture quality that many other brands would ask more for.

I couldn't ask for a better deal on this monitor.  I don't know what people are saying about the base not being sturdy enough I took a chance and disregarding those comments and went with this monitor and my choice couldn't have been better.

I use this as a multiple monitor to expand my desktop for work and do not watch videos or play games on it, so the perceived \"slowness\" of IPS monitors wasn't a concern of mine. The video processor software I have through Nvidea makes using this monitor a snap with my laptop as I plug it in after using the laptop elsewhere. My only complaint would be the wobbliness of the monitor on the stand, which I was aware of from other reviewers but did not think would be a problem. It really isn't a problem most of the time unless I really jostle my desk but at some point I plan to get another monitor and use a VESA wall mount for both which will eliminate the problem.

When I unboxed it, I found no defects, no scratches, and all of the promised parts.  When I plugged it in, I did what probably everyone does: I played the most vibrant, high-definition videos I could.  The first thing I looked for were dead pixels.  Everything one of them seemed to be in working condition.  Then I started comparing it to the other monitors (and LED TV we use as our primary monitor) and found that the picture was not quite as sharp, and there was a yellow tint to it.  I had been reading the reviews for different monitors when choosing one and remembered someone having a similar issue to this (I believe the display name is M. Chang).  He purchased the same model as one he prviously owned, and noted that the new one had a yellow tint."},

Using some LCD monitor test images, I could not discern any off-angle color changes before 30 degrees from perpendicular view, which gives uniform coloration for the entire screen from normal viewing distances.  That is nowhere near the 178 degree viewing angle advertised, but perfect for a single viewer.  My old LCD monitor could not display uniformity of horizontal or vertical color from even twice the width of the screen away, so this is an enormous improvement for me."},

I will give a word of advise to anyone mounting these as I did so they don't make the dumb mistake I made.  When you remove the stand bracket make sure you immediately replace the screws you removed.  I did not and went right to mounting the wall mount bracket.  The end result is the 2 retention clips came loose and now they rattle around the back of my monitor.  Other than that the only thing I can complain about is the included DVI cables rather than HDMI.  Overall these are excellent monitors with outstanding contrast at a bargain price."},

A lot of reviews really get out of hand with the expectations they had. I mean lets start with it is a USB powered monitor, and does not have a AC power supply. So yeah, the colors are not going to be the most vivid, nor will it be the brightest, it's running on the little bit of power from a USB port, so give it a break there. The resolution is not a huge issue to me. I got this monitor for the purpose of having a second display for school work, since I have e-books for some classes, I wanted a second screen for the book to leave my laptop screen free to do the homework. The resolution is equivalent to that of a lower end laptop. If you really want a higher brightness, color spectrum, and higher resolution, move to a monitor that is not powered via USB.

This feature is not even on by default, not that I would use it anyway. I suspect its true contrast ratio would be lower than the typical 1000:1, which is why it's omitted both here on Amazon and on the Acer website. Coming from glossy HP monitors, the colors just seem very washed out. Dark grays turn into medium grays, etc. That's partially due to its matte finish, but it's also partially due to it being a budget IPS display. I now have another professional matte display by Dell (U2515H) that has great contrast, comparable to my glossy HP displays (27xi). If you're going to buy an affordable IPS display, I would recommend going glossy, unless you are in a super high-glare environment.

I'm sure there are better monitors out there for PC gaming, but for my intended purposes (1080p with headphone jack), this was a great value."},

On their web site, they have a manual you can download but I could only get the \"global version\" and then I discovered that I would be charged for the software that I needed to install to download the manual!  I have also through trial and error discovered that there are actually three ways to connect it to your computer.  There is a VGA outlet, a DVI outlet and an HDMI outlet.  Since I do not do games, I had no idea about the VGA cable and my computer does not even have an outlet for a HDMI cable.  I started out trying to connect all three.

Well not only will this monitor allow me to hook up to both platforms,  it can automatically sense which input is being used and switch over.  The picture is very crisp and clean and you also have the option to select different picture qualities.  And what I mean by that is you can choose gaming or energy saving mode, movie, standard or you can customize to your liking.  This item came in roughly 2 to 3 days.  It was packed very well and did not have any trouble putting the stand together.  The stand does tilt a little bit down and back.  The only negative thing I saw is there was no option for a mount."},

It doesnt come with speakers but thats okay.  I also like that it has a VGA port and comes with VGA cables since for some reason my laptop only came with a VGA port rather than an HDMI port.  Its decently light so I can move it around the room easily and it helps that there is an indentation at the top which acts like a handle.  The screen looks awesome and works really well.

It's very bright and the colors are outstanding compared to my 9 year old monitor. I use the \"scenery\" preset and turn the brightness down to \"35\". I might even turn it down a little more, it's so bright. It's about the same height as my 20\" 4x3 monitor but about 5 inches wider. So the size is great. And the 30 watts it uses is far less then the 60 watts my old one uses. So I hope to save a few bucks on my electric bill. Maybe I should have gone with a 27\" but I could not justify at least $100 more for an extra 2.5\" wider. I don't think I would notice it much anyway. I just put the monitor a little closer and bam!

The lighting on the screen is consistent from the center to each edge and corner. All text is even and crisp. All images are clear. The amount of screen space that I have has been nearly tripled, and the screen works very well for displaying multiple windows.

The screen is very nice to look at and handles anything I want to throw at it at any resolution with no issue."},

For those looking to just connect and go, this probably isn't what you're looking for as they don't have built in speakers.  For me though, these fit the bill with the HDMI input and DVI Inputs allowing all items connected to work flawlessly, however I ran RCA cables to the surround sound speakers for my computer.  Of course this means that I have to get up to change the volume or turn the monitors on or off, it is absolutely worth the trade off for the price and quality.  These are a decided improvement over my old Samsung HD TV that was having to work as my display for my computer, cable and Xbox."},

Picture seems very clear and responsive. I'm not challenging it's capabilities with games and what-not, but it's serving it's intended no-frills purpose admirably.  My only problem was the instruction guide/paper is next to useless, though translated into 20+ languages. Luckily, the menu system (and button navigation) is fairly straight-forward."},

They offer either HDMI/DVI/VGA connection which makes them very diverse.  Color and brightness is quite good.  There is really no heat generation out of the panel.  I also really like the stand the panel sits on, it is nice and small, sleek, and unobtrusive.  In my case with a dual screen setup the bezel was an area of concern but it is small enough that it doesn't really interfere with multitasking (about 3/4\" on the sides)."},

First thing that struck me was how light this unit is. That's a plus, Compared to my old Dell LCD it was night and day. The second is the stand. It is very poorly engineered and is frankly a detraction against what appears to be a otherwise decent product for the price. I havnt had a chance to really use it for gaming yet as I am having issues with my video card which will be replaced shortly, but for all other purposes it seems adequate enough. I watch shows via streaming and it looks solid, the only issue I really have aside from the stand is the light. I cannot seem to contrast it enough so it dosnt look washed out text wise(edited to add after I wrote this I fiddled with it more and it looks much better). I suscribe this however to running it on a generic vga mode. Once I effect my video card replacement I should be able to adjust it more to my liking. One other aspect is the on board controls. It is frankly impossible for me to really see the tiny icons on the monitor. I made my adjustments based on the instruction booklet and using trail and error. It isn't rocket science to do, but they could have done a much better job of indicating the on board controls and perhaps illuminating them. Overall at this point I give it a 4 out of 5."},

After this latest flight, I opened it up to see a big white box in the middle of the screen with what looks like a bean shape in the middle, that blurs over to the side. This obviously isn't a quality made display, as I've seen others with this issue in the reviews. I just wish I'd read further before I purchased one myself. For a second lightweight monitor that you might use at home but not transport anywhere, it is adequate (as I said, not the greatest resolution, but still workable).

I have a motherboard in my desktop, a notebook, monitor, and all of them have been great. But this monitor has a very serious problem: it cannot play nicely with an NVIDIA card. You will get washed out colors, with light blacks and yellow tints. Search around, and the internet will tell you to tweak a few things (turning off the RGB helps) but nothing can fix it -- as I found out when I finally gave up and contacted ASUS tech support. I'm sure this is a nice monitor - if you don't use one of the most popular graphics cards in the world. The reason, as best I can tell from the various theories among the game and monitor experts out there, is that the monitor only has HDMI ports (unless you use Displayport), and the HDMI-to-DVI throttles the colors in a way that DVI to DVI does not (or something to that effect). Whatever it is, you can see it if you use two monitors: white on one side is yellow-ish on the other. And my other monitor is an excellent ASUS 25\" I bought a few years ago - and the color on that one is superb.

There are six different modes which you have to choose from and each has their own preset settings. Under these settings, you can change only a few settings, but not others. The mode I chose had decent colors and picture, but I couldn't change the brightness so I now have to deal with my eyes being burned out of my skull. Which, well, pisses me off. I didn't read anything about this setting before buying, and if I had seen that, I wouldn't have purchased it. I have had this monitor for nearly eight months now (used largely for gaming and school work), and I couldn't take it anymore so I bought an Acer.

I would agree with these complaints, but for the low price of the monitor, you could always buy a better stand.

I fixed the problem by wrapping Scotch tape around the plug to take up the extra space, so that it wouldn't be so loose. This did the trick and I have not had any problems since.

It's like the monitor has an automatic adjuster, except it sucks (SmartView IS turned OFF). It's not terribly often, but is annoying when it does happen. Haven't found a fix yet.

The 3.5mm headphone jack is really convenient if you don't feel like plugging your cheap PC speakers into the motherboard, and HDMI input is nice too since the cables are so easy to come by any more and provide an audio source for the headphone jack. The screen size is not too big for twitch shooters, but not too small for expansive RPG environments or playing splitscreen, but it is of course a matter of opinion. The settings and presets you can choose in the menu do an okay job adapting the screen for different uses (night mode, gaming, theater), but ultimately don't make much of a difference for your average guy who just wants a decent monitor. On-screen text looks very crisp and clear, no blurring issues whatsoever. The screen does tilt with a little force, and the build quality is pretty good; the stand can feel a bit flimsy at times, but for the money, you're still getting an excellent display that you will not be disappointed with."},

My old monitor was a Gateway 2007 (And I don't think those are even being made anymore) But this monitor even at its lowest resolution is leagues better.I would recommend it. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes when I am gaming, (Fallout New Vegas for example) if I go into a pitch black area the screen goes off. I don't know if its something to do with the settings and resolution or what. But I just got this 2 days ago, so I will figure that out. Other than that, this is a great monitor to own!"},

I have played many games and movies on this monitor without seeing a impact on performance due to the 5ms refresh rate (FPS games work just fine, i notice no frame hiccups or input lag).

Well, I can tell you the jump  is HUGE. My monitor came in the mail with no problems like dead pixels or light bleeds that many have had before.

The IPS panel gives it good viewing angles with good color saturation, and the response time (if you want to game on it) is a very respectable 5ms. The on screen menus are fairly easy to navigate, and it has VESA support. The design is nothing to write home about and the monitor stand is pretty pathetic. It will wobble very easily assuming you put it on a surface that would be prone to being bumped. Mine also has a strange input issue were you will have to manually hit the input button again for HDMI (recommend using DVI as it comes with a cable and it solves the issue).

The plastic casing on that one has started to scratch up a bit as it didn't come with a case, but it works like a charm. Frankly, even if it crapped out on me at this point, I'd still think it was worth the money given how inexpensive they are.

It pivots upward and downward which is very useful, but you can only rotate it on the base or if you loosen the screw (which I would not recommend) you can turn it. The screw keeps the entire unit very stable and it is very easy to learn how to use the command buttons. The power cord is quite short, however, so I would recommend buying a longer one. It has a DVI, VGA and HDMI port on the back. The computer comes with a DVI and a VGA cable and I had an HDMI cable so i tested all of them out.

I use it with Windows 7 Pro 64 bit and the image is great.  It has 3 separate inputs for VGA, HDMI, and DVI.  It doesn't have speakers or a webcam, but it does have an output jack to plug in your own speakers.  It has menu buttons on the lower right to select input and make adjustments to the screen.  I would highly recommend this ASUS monitor to anyone looking for one in this size.  You can pay more, but you wont necessarily get more."},

When you get it, it's set to VGA input. If you plug in HDMI (I have a PS/3 plugged in all the time and sometimes a VGA tablet) it says \"no input detected\" and goes into sleep mode. There is no opportunity to use the menu and switch inputs. You have to plug in a VGA input and then utilize the menu to switch to HDMI. If you unplug (or turn off) the HDMI input and plug in a VGA device the same will then happen. Bad design imo, and no mention in the manual. This would have been easy to build around."},

Seeing as I game from my laptop, I decided now was the time to finally purchase a monitor.

The monitor itself is a sleek black frame with a bright vivid display.  Personally, I did not experience the wobbliness of the stand that I have read so much about in the reviews.  In addition, another added benefit does include a $20 mail in rebate.  However, it was a pain to go through the process of filling forms out only to receive $18 after a $2 fee, if I wanted my rebate within a reasonable amount of time.  Granted I have only had the monitor for a week, I do not regret my purchase in the least bit.  So much so, I decided to purchase another Asus VS247H-P for a dual monitor set up!

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Excellent monitor by Acer", "review_body": "Excellent value for money. I suspect this to be one of the best choices of monitors in the category. I am very satisfied with it's performance and have found no evidence of leaks around the perimeter (as a review I had read might have suggested). Picture image is absolutely steady and color and detail are vivid and sharp. The frame around the image is arguably the thinnest in its category. This is a big plus when it comes to long sessions of work. Also, it would be a plus when using multiple monitors. As I expected, there is a relatively wide viewing angle from any direction - so there is little need to adjust the stand constantly. Again, during long sessions of work I change my angle and height of viewing quite a bit, the wide viewing angle is much more comfortable in such cases. One small issue I have noticed while testing is that I would have preferred a height adjustment on the stand. My preferred viewing height would have been about an inch shorter than the fixed 4.5 inch height (bottom of image to desktop). Sometimes I have to place the monitor on a standard tabletop at work, which is particularly where this need becomes apparent. I thought of mentioning this only for the manufacturers, but it is not really a big problem since I am quite accustomed to it even at this time, three weeks after putting the monitor into use. Since I use this monitor with a new build, its generic drivers were installed by Windows during assembly. However, I replaced these with the Acer drivers. Regardless of how impressed I was with this monitor, I have to state that although I have been a computer builder and business user/enthusiast for many years, I have not been able to figure out how to use the physical buttons on the monitor to tweak its settings - I gave up and used the Windows Control Panel instead. The monitor comes well tuned and does not need much or any tweaking out of the box. Overall, I think most customers would be entirely satisfied with buy and I recommend it highly."},

Was nearly impossible to enjoy games, cause blacks looked gray in that part of the screen. Also what is with everyone abandoning 1920x1200 resolution. I give it two stars cause the price is good, and when turned off it looks great. I am sure it is a great monitor, as long as you are lucky. Sent it back and went with a Dell IPS screen instead."},

The neck that runs from the base to the monitor is very flimsy. This isn't too big of a problem while the monitor is sitting on the desk, but it gets annoying when you're trying to push the buttons and the whole screen shakes. I also don't understand why some of the menu items are unchangeable, such as saturation, sharpness, etc., but the picture is fine how it is, so I'm not complaining."},

But, it came with a big dead pixel shining like the north star at 10 o'clock center, the loose plug mentioned in other reviews is driving me nuts--move it just a little and it disconnects, and I gave up trying to figure out how to change any of the settings, it's crazy. Sure, they have a downloadable manual from their website, but it's useless, and the Asus website itself is just the same, never ran into more pages not available.  Weird.  All this would be not so bad, I might even go 4 stars, were not for the fact that this monitor's streaming video is totally awful, it blinks, and between blinks it looks like I'm watching from underwater sometimes and other times the images wrinkle in little waves.  Nice price though.  I like the energy star too, but hesitate to recommend this to anyboy."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Excellent - Happy with Purchase", "review_body": "Monitor is sharp. Colors are true and outstanding. No dead pixels. The monitor has numerous preset color variations that you can select, depending on what you're viewing or working on (movies, gaming, or using a word processing or graphics program), and of course, you can modify and customize your own.  However, the default normal setting has been working just fine for me.  Upon setup, the display almost seemed too large, but I've adapted well to it.  I use it mostly for music composition (sequencing) and watching movies, so having that extra wide viewing area is great. The monitor has built-in speakers, but since I use studio monitors for sound, I've disabled them.  One thing to be aware of is that the monitor will add it own sound driver and use it in addition to your computer's sound card to drive the speakers in the monitor. This confused me at first because I couldn't figure out why I was hearing sound from somewhere else other than from the headphones i was wearirng it the time. When I took off the headphones, I was still hearing sound and couldn't figure out where it was coming from.  I later realized that the sound was coming from behind the monitor. All you need to do is go into the control panel and disable the other driver. Yes, I would definitely recommend this monitor."},

One had a huge scratch and the other had a section of the screen that was slightly blueish, only I couldn't tell until my replacement came in for the scratched one, and they were side by side.  It's taken a few weeks to get what I want (though the return process is super easy), but I like the monitors now that they are in prime condition.  Great color.  The stands are flimsy though, especially if you are used to something more substantial like a Dell.  I ended up getting a beefy dual monitor stand, but without that, the screen would shake while typing."},

If you connect with an HDMI cable, the 2nd button to the right is how you change input modes. It took me forever to figure that out because that wasn't addressed in the manual. Also, the power plug can be hard to plug into the back of the monitor, but that could be because I was scared of breaking it. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase."},

I already had a monitor in mind, but when I came across this ASUS I really saw the extra benefits it provided besides the other.

I followed the online instructions for returning items provided by Amazon and received confirmation of a full refund (minus my initial shipping cost, not the shipping cost of returning it) within a few days.

Although the reviews were mixed on this particular model, I decided to go with it anyway, since it happened to be the best selling monitor on Amazon at the time.  Someone out there definitely knows what they're buying.  This monitor proved to be everything it advertised, it gave a very sharp HD picture with no glare, controls were easy to use and the tilt adjustment is really nice.  As a bonus, I was a little concerned about the base being wobbly from the reviews I read, but surprisingly, it is quite sturdy once you tighten the screw.  The only thing I would have liked would've been a height adjustment, but at this price, it really is a lot of ask.  You also shouldn't look for a speaker with this particular monitor; the plug-in jack on the back is fine.  If you're really concerned with sound, buy some quality speakers and plug them into the back of your computer.  You're not going to get good speakers on a monitor, anyway, especially at this price.  Like I said from the beginning, this is a great monitor, we happened to buy it for gaming, and if you're looking for something solid for the price, look no further."},

I went through the whole troubleshooting process. Plugging in another monitor, new cables, another computer, everything. It isnt software related. I WON'T BE CALLING ASUS CUSTOMER SERVICE OR MAILING THEM ANYTHING! I have already read about the horrible and shifty experiences with them. I cracked that baby open myself. Loose VESA mounting plate. Loose/Ill fitting video port mounts. I can't believe it didn't rattle. It all seemed careless or rushed. Either the folks who worked on it or the machines that put it together, are malfunctioning lol. I did get it fixed, I had to do a little soldering and some screwing, but it works....PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO DO IT YOURSELF! Look for another product.

For me all it took was taking the CD to install the driver, restarting my computer then plugging it in. The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars though is because the plug is too loose for my taste... It's almost as if I put any opposite force on the cord it will get unplugged then move all the windows I had on this monitor over to my main monitor. It's fine if you are stationary and don't move anything near the cord but if you're using a laptop and move it around it can be frustrating when it pops out. It's my first time using an extra monitor and I guess I learned the hard way to understand why the USB extension was recommended with this item. It would be nice to put some USB connections over to the side then plug this monitor into that connection since the cord gets in my way. Overall, I think I made it sound worse than it really is since it's largely my fault whenever this cord gets unplugged but I've also only had it for less than a month and I feel as though the plug in for the cord got looser."},

But after I turn the monitor off then on, it works normal again. I run a dual monitor and my much older monitor never had an issue with that. It's not a big problem and a easy fix, it just sucks that it happens."},

It's not height adjustable but it is tilt adjustable (forward and back). The screen isn't shiny, it's more of a matte type of material. Still great though. Had no dead pixels when I got it and hopefully it stays that way. I'm currently using it for my PS3 because my PC isn't done being built yet. All you need is an HDMI cord for that.

Now about the OSD, it works very well and navigation is pretty easy and simple, yet it feels very restricted. For example if I choose the settings that gives me the most accurate color correction which would be \"sRGB\" it will lock pretty much every setting in the menu.

I can state definitively that all of the required documentation was provided in its original form.  I cannot state that ASUS had no intention of honoring the rebate.  However, if you are making a purchase decision for this monitor based on the post-purchase mail-in rebate of $20.00 you should factor in the likelihood that you will be declined."},

Has enough ports/connectivity if you aren't need crazy amounts of additional hookups.

This Asus monitor looks amazing, is bright, is crisp, handles all my intense gaming graphics, shows off amazing high def pictures my daughter takes with her high-end camera, and I can open up several windows and multitask.  I had no problems with drivers or making this primary to a two-monitor set up. Amazon.com's price was great, as usual!  And the service was fast!

The replacement one is very nice. 1080p monitor on a 22\" feels right, as pixels are not noticeable until you put your eyes next to the monitor. Any monitor above 22\" with resolution of 1920x1080 wouldn't be as sharp honestly. After that monitors would have to be 2560x1440 to be sharp, and would be more expensive.

The text on this monitor versus my five year old Dell's was grainy and difficult to read. So I adjusted some settings and while the color seemed better, the text was still awful. So, my second course of action was to try DVI. On DVI this monitor works much better. My HDMI was a high quality cable and I'm powering my monitors using a dual GPU.

Also the stand doesn't fit snugly; I bought a wall mount from HumanCentric for $30 but beware of getting it into this display - it's a super tight fit & it's only my dogged persistnt nature that enabled me to pound the bracket into it w/o breking the display - thankfully. as another reviewer wrote, ACER should make a wall mount that works availabke for this large a display at a reasonable price!"},

Controls are also kind of terrible, but they work and hopefully you don't mess with them a lot. Color and clarity are what you expect on a cheap monitor, which these days is quite good.

I remember reading some reviews about how the stand is wobbly, but it doesn't seem wobbly at all to me, and I have a pretty unstable desk.  In fact, I would go so far as to say the stand is stable, and a strong point for this product.  When assembling the stand, which was very easy, make sure you insert the plastic tab into the hole, then tighten the screw.  Anyway, I would highly recommend this product.

As expected they do not make it easy to get the rebate, not expected were two complications, first the $20 is in the form of an American Express gift card, 2nd, when you sign up for the rebate you are asked whether you want \"expedited service\" for a $2 fee, then you will get the rebate in 7-10 days, basic service with no fee is 8-10 weeks.

The difference is night and day...The ASUS is sharper and brighter.

The stand the monitor sits on is weak and the monitor will wobble with the slightest touch or movement of the desk or whatever it may be sitting on.  This hasn't been an issue for us as we don't have an enviroment where the shaking could happen.

The monitor is useless to me at this moment, but the failure to be used for the computers which only have USB2.0 is not the fault of AOC international and The failure does not constitute the action of 'returning' the device to them.  I just swallowed the results - this is my own fault.  The manual says clearly it is USB3.0 powered.  I learned the lesson.  One thing I want to warn Amazon and all the customes. When I trying to find if I could find a converter from USB2.0 to USB3.0, I have a dozen of replies.  I guess there are a few was only for phishing.  My computers almost be hijacked. I believer that Amazon has very secure system for their website, but the \"answering question' might be a \"backdoor' for hackers.

Trying to use a feather duster to clean creates static cling that magnetizes dust sticking. I don't expect a whole lot for the price, but this monitor was given the go back.

I could have done without having to make a 1/2\" spacer out of plywood, purchasing an angled power cord and longer screws.  The HDMI cable just barely clears the stand as well.  i like being able to see the inputs but they really need to be moved to the side more.  i hope someone from Asus sees this and passes it on to whoever is responsible.

There are warnings against putting too much pressure on the screen. I felt as if I could easily break it. I was using it w IOS so PC users may have more luck with screen adjustments, but even with the downloaded software I could not make this useable and not irritating."},

When compared side-by-side with my existing 22\" Apple Cinema Display, I can honestly say that it has better color, much better contrast and intensity, and overall works like a charm. It does take a bit to get the colors sorted out, the defaults are a little lacking. Makes an excellent primary display for AutoCAD, 3ds Max, and is spectacular for gaming; Tomb Raider, MW3, and Metro: Last Light all look great! It has a very nice, small footprint which enables very flexible positioning in unusual, or tight layouts."},

The 24\" for home use, including gaming and hd movies, is splendid and immersive sitting a short distance away. As with any monitor however, one runs the risk of confronting a damaged pixel. At first, I believe at least as I have had bad pixels before, the monitor was in perfect condition.  After 2 weeks, a small white dot appeared in the lower center of my screen.  Dead and stuck pixels drive me crazy, but after returning so many monitors for them, I gave up on this one.  The pixel is stuck and white but on this monitor is much less noticeable than others.  So I will be keeping this, despite the annoyance I am just forcing myself to deal with.  I do not wish to go through the process of waiting for a new monitor to come in again and this monitor is good enough even with the white pixel."},

The display is bright and sharp, and the unit's menu offers a variety of options to fine tune the picture. The 22\" display is great for viewing all eight channels of our security system simultaneously, though you'd want to go bigger if you had a twelve or sixteen camera setup.

It's very elegant to work with such a thin border and I believe it is one of the thinnest models you can obtain (of quality) for the price. The back shell is glossy, which I would have preferred if they designed it with a matte finish instead, but that's my only minor comment. Some of you have inquired about the very minor light bleeding. And that's exactly right - it is very minor and only apparent when the screen is on a dark standby or when you are viewing an entire black background. As light spectrum is added, this becomes unnoticeable. The other contender I considered, was the AOC i2367fh, which is an elegant monitor. But functionality wise, and while also trying to maintain an overall familiar design in my workspace - the R240hy wins, without sacrificing any quality. Again, images and vibrance is beautiful and zero gloss or distortion from any angle. You'll easily spend hours, just testing hd images on this thing : ) Enjoy!"},

Occasionally it would show a black screen or a static screen for a few seconds, then return to normal.  We thought it was a glitch that could be fixed by resetting the monitor to factory settings, or trying a different computer.  Neither solution worked and the issues got more frequent over the next few weeks.

When I got them I performed some very basic adjustments on them.  I feel like the adjustment menu could be slightly easier to use.  Like most TVs these monitors had the brightness turned all the way up which was apparent next to my 24\" dell.  These monitors are extremely light weigh, so light that when adjusting them they move.

I recently returned an ASUS \"frameless\" monitor due to poor image quality. The ACER R240HY was significantly cheaper and much better image quality. The R240HY doesn't have speakers built in but does have a headphone jack, I'm guessing for audio passthrough from the HDMI cable. I don't use this feature others might though. Playing with some of the settings I noticed something called \"OD\" , enabling this setting had a really bad impact on video playback, I almost packed the monitor back up to be returned but turning this setting off immediately restored excellent video quality. I downloaded and looked through the manual but found nothing explaining what this setting does, as far as I can tell there is no benefit to having it on at all. It only comes with a VGA cable which is pretty sad but unfortunately kind of normal, why, I don't understand, but the price of this monitor makes it much easier to add a HDMI cable to your order.The frame on this monitor is very slim and the screen is a nice matte that doesn't reflect any light that I can see at all. Very happy so far. I'm not a gamer really so I can't comment on how this monitor performs with games, it says it has a 4ms response time for the in-panel switching so it should be fast enough and not ghost too bad but maybe someone else can comment definitively on gaming with this."},

I wish it was VESA compatible but the included stand is fine. It doesn't tilt or raise/lower so I got a small stand to raise it up. The ports are easily accessible and all point out at a perpendicular angle so you don't have to blindly feel around for them which is nice. I really like the super thin bezel around the sides and top.

For the price back then I thought I got a really good deal. Accurate colors, good size, fast response time, and overall build quality (except the glossy scratch magnet that is the front bezel and base). Jump forward to last month and similar situation - I built another computer for someone and they needed an inexpensive monitor for it. We ordered this one again and put both side by side to compare. The screens looked identical (sometimes an issue when getting the same monitors at different times). Seeing how it's still a good monitor after years (and dropped in price), I'm tempted to get myself another one for a dual monitor setup (1440p and up monitors are still overpriced in my opinion).

I realize it's only 1600 x 900, not 1920 x 1080 like my laptop, but I was willing to run my laptop in 1600 x 900 mode when using the monitor.  I have a 23\" 1920 x 1080 monitor for my home office and would only use the AOC when out at clients (I'm a business consultant) so about 25% of the time.  I loaded the software and everything seemed to work fine.  In fact, the first couple times I went back and forth between my 23\" home office monitor and the AOC portable, my laptop's screen actually remembered to switch resolution accordingly so I didn't have to change it every time manually.  However, here's where it started to go wrong:"},

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Good gaming monitor for a low price.", "review_body": "All in all I think you'll be hard pressed to find a better gaming monitor for such a low price, but there are definitely a few things to be aware of with this monitor. First, it seriously needs a break in period, it takes several days of use for the monitor to really come alive. I don't think I've ever had a monitor that looked so much better after it's break-in. Before break in I was about to return the monitor, colors were very washed out, the edges of the display were sort of foggy and the monitor had a lot of ghosting. I fiddled with setting and got it to a point that was reasonable but I was far from impressed. Still I didn't have time to return it right then and figured I'd give it a little more time. after a few days, with only a few hours use per day, the monitor started to become more what I had expected. The ghosting stopped, the colors warmed up and the darks got a lot better. There is still a little bit of that fogginess around the edges but it's minimal and I only notice it if I look for it. The darks on the monitor are still fairly washed out but it isn't terrible. Where this monitor shines is the quick response time and complete lack of input lag. the screen in general just looks to be much more clear than my previous one as well. If you aren't too picky and want a good gaming monitor this one is worth a try. Make sure to let it break in before you judge it though. And on amazon, if you decide you don't like it you can just send it right back!"},

I got this monitor on sale for an amazing $139.99 with free shipping (prime).  I suggest you wait till Black Friday to get the best savings on this monitor.  The only minor con is the slightly wobbly base, which isn't a big deal as long as you have a sturdy desk/table.

I ended up purchasing from another retailer since Amazon had it on back order during the time I needed it for extended travel while working. Based on the negative reviews about the USB connection failing, presumably due to poor soldering, I decided to buy the extended 4-year warranty. I also followed the advice of some reviewers that found ways to secure the USB cable to the back of the monitor in order to try and prevent the connection from failing prematurely. I think this should be a good way to extend the life of the connection. As an aside, friends and family often bring me their cheap external hard drives that stopped working for me to fix, and 9 out of 10 times, they've failed merely due to a faulty USB connection because the solder was shoddy and wore out in time. In almost every case, I've been able to install the drive in a new enclosure and it's worked just fine.

When looking through what drivers support this monitor (inspecting the \"Details\" document for each driver) it's very difficult to figure out what one is going to work for this monitor on Windows 10 - I had to download and install then uninstall a few. Due to the sheer lack of cooperation between the company and their supplier (DisplayLink provides the display chips to AOC, I think), they make it difficult to determine what software (drivers) you need for your exact hardware (monitor) purchase.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Refurbished in perfect condition for $100", "review_body": "I purchased this monitor 1. While on sale at $130 2. Refurbished in perfect condition for $100. Although it is very rare that you will find this kind of deal, if you can, pick it up immediately. This is the best purchase I've made in a while and even if not refurbished. This is a 24\" IPS 1080P screen for $130 people. A VERY competitive price point for a great product. Did I mention it's basically bezzless? 60HZ Is more than plenty for your average gamer or content consumer, and personally I already owned a DVI chord before the purchase. But you will need one or an HDMI chord, heads up. Doesn't come with it."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Crisp, bright, great colors", "review_body": "This monitor is really gorgeous. It's simple to set up (just plug it in and go), and while I may tweak with the color/brightness/contrast settings eventually, it works great right out of the box. The colors are rich and vibrant, and it's a very bright monitor. What's more, I really love how much screen space you get. The bevel on the top and sides is tiny, which means you get maximum screen space for the size of the monitor. The footprint of the monitor is actually smaller than the one it replaced, but I'm getting more screen space. This is a great monitor for the price, I'm very happy with it."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "You get what you paid for.", "review_body": "This monitor is very nice for what it costs but it's not nearly as spectacular as most of the reviews says. The picture has great colors but it is grainy and suffers from SDE (screen door effect) which many people probably wouldn't even notice but the ones who would will find it pretty annoying. Enough so that I definitely recommend going for a higher end monitor if that's an issue for you. Otherwise, if you're on a tight budget and want something solid, this will do fine."}
