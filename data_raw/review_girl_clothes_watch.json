They are more of a nude shade. I was so confused on what size to order. My daughter is 2 1/2 and in the 50th percentile for weight and height.  She wear a size 7- 7.5 shoe. They were out of the 8.5 so I had to decide between the 8 or the 9 unless I wanted the 8.5 narrow or the 8.5 wide. I chose the 8 regular. When I pulled it out of the box the shoes seemed SOO TINY! I thought for sure they would never fit but to my suprise they fit perfect! I would buy again. I wouldnt say that she has a lot of room to grow into that much, but for less than $20 i dont mind. We should get maybe 6 months use out of them I'm guessing."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "For Sizing Information please read!", "review_body": "Ballet shoes (and even different brands) all have their own strange system of sizing - the sizes do not compare to normal street shoe sizing.  According to the Capezio manufacturer, their toddler/little kid ballet shoes are to be ordered one full size up from their current street shoe size.  Bloch brand kids ballet shoes are to be sized up 1/2 size.  (If you order adult shoes, they're often sized down 2 or 3 sizes...) Any dancewear store will have this information, but unfortunately Amazon doesn't provide this tidbit, so it can be quite confusing as to what size to order.  I hope this helps any future purchasers!"},

(I'm so glad I took their sizing advice). I ordered the pink, and it looks just like the picture, great quality material. You can even tighten the lace for an even more snug fit.  My only complaint is that the knot tied from the string comes undone quite often (at least once or more every time she wears them), even when I double tie the knot, this is only reason I'm giving it a 4 stars."},

Due to ordering first bloch ballet shoes, I learned my lesson of ordering a wide ballet shoes for my daughter in capezio brand because even if she has a small feet it was quite tight with bloch brand. I ordered size 6.5 for my daughter that wears 5.5 and it fits her perfect theres few mm extra to grow but since its leather it will strech a little more overtime. The color is not really pink more like nude. The straps are wider than bloch and tighter. In comparison with size from two brands mentioned my daughter wears the same 6.5 size with both brands... shes 6.5 W with capezio and 6.5 C with bloch 5.5 with regular shoes"},

I don\u2019t know anything about ballet shoes or how they should fit. Ok, going forward - these shoes seem to be good quality. We have a hard time finding shoes that fit my little girl\u2019s wide feet and the wide shoes fit great. I read other reviews to order a 1-1.5 sizes up. I decided to order TWO sizes up to leave room to grow. Unfortunately, they won\u2019t fit for long. These shoes run SUPER, SUPER SMALL. Again, these are great shoes but I strongly recommend ordering two sizes up."},

I\u2019ve already had to return one pair and I needed these ASAP. These are not only at least a whole size too small but they\u2019re very narrow in the toes and I ordered a medium not a narrow shoe. My kid does not have fat feet I\u2019m pretty sure... all other regular shoes fit her and I\u2019ve never had to buy anything wide.  I tried to do a return based on an accurate item description and it wasn\u2019t allowed. What a scam.  As you can see in this photo they\u2019re next to a pair of size 5 shoes these are way smaller and there\u2019s supposedly a size 7!! I\u2019m so peeved."},

The strap, however, was not sewn as pictured here, but a good inch further back toward the heel. It will fit your child perfectly if she doesn't have ankles. Because we need these for a holiday performance, there wasn't time to return, so I cut out the straps and resewed them in the proper place. Frustrating."},

We tried several ballet shoes and had to return them because of this. Finally we bought this one (way cheaper here on Amazon than directly from her dance school, but same brand). She LOVES them. Wants to wear them all the time. She's usually a size 11, but I ordered 11.5 so she has some extra space for comfort, and it was perfect. It also helped when I understood that the bow in the front was not just for decoration, but it actually tightens the sides for a better fit."},

It's not as stiff as it was previously, and seems to be softer and more comfortable, but it's nowhere near as warm.  We've been using this for a heavy winter coat for years, but this time can only use it at a heavyish jacket, and had to get her a different coat for when it gets very cold out.  Won't be buying this again when she grows out of it next time."},

She is extremely tall but lean and this jacket is perfect with room to grow. It's not crazy big but it's not a perfect fit, it's roomy. I want it to last a couple of years so I sized up. The pink is the exact color you see in the picture and I don't think the picture does this jacket justice, it is just beautiful. The Sherpa lining is so nice, I love that it has a hood and the back is slightly longer which I also love. Overall great jacket and definitely true to size. If I'd ordered her normal size 6  it would be a perfect fit. Great quality as well, feels and looks well made."},

I wanted it a little big because I was hoping to get another year out of it next year. I received fast prompt shipping. It was packaged neatly and easy to open. It arrived in perfect condition. It is true to color in the picture. A really lovely girly shade of pink which my toddler loved! I have to say, I love Carhartt jackets. Growing up my dad had one and I remember it lasting just about forever. After receiving my daughter's jacket I think hers would last forever too. The quality of material is great! The exterior is sturdy and strong. I think it will hold up well to her rough and tumble ways. The weight of the jacket is nice too. I live in Texas so we don't get bad winters here. I needed a jacket that was warmer than a sweatshirt and lighter than a snow jacket. This fit the bill. The inside is super soft. My daughter squealed when we put it on her and she immediately wanted to go outside in it. It's a little roomy on her so she could easily wear a sweater under it. The hood has elastic sewn in around the edge so it stays around her face when it's up. Very happy with our purchase!"},

However, within a period of one or two days, the boot went from fitting just fine and being equal to the other boot, to being significantly smaller.

Once he gets them on though, they fit great. He's 2 so, he doesn't understand \"push your foot all the way in\" lol I pull and pull on them, but he just has to walk or run in them for a few minutes before his foot goes all the way in.

These fit her perfectly....which means they are a little smaller than her regular shoes (since her size 9 sandals are a little loose still).

For the price, the watch quality and appearance is excellent. There are major design flaws however that parents of younger children should know about. I'm 45 years old, and have had various digital and analog watches since I was about 8. This has the strangest setting parameters I've ever seen. To change time or date - you simply push the bottom left button three times - even with a long pause between pushes - and you're in setting mode. Yea, isn't that great for kids? Then, pushing any button but the bottom right again, will create some kind of change. It has long memory, so it stays in setting mode. My kids mess it up at least once per week. One of them has stopped wearing it because the digital time is constantly messed up. My Casio watch when I was 12 years old had the year/month/date system PROGRAMMED into the watch. This dumb watch expects you to set the day of the week and actual day of the month  independently - no year is programmable. My kids mess all these settings up, amazingly, every single week since Christmas. PM/AM is hard to see/figure out initially. Lastly, the analog and digital don't stay in sync for more than maybe 12 hours - at the most. That drives my older boy a bit crazy - so I'm having to re-set that all the time, too. If you have an older child less prone to pushing buttons/playing around, go for it - it is a very attractive watch. For younger kids, stay far away from this watch."},

I had to put the watch on her wrist, since the stiffness of the band made it had for her to thread the end through the loops and such.  It was a little difficult for me to do.  So she wore it to school, after me convincing her to try it.  She was nervous about operating the band if she needed to...  Guess what?  The watch came off at some point...  and...  was never to be heard from again.  I'm giving it 3 stars, since overall it was a good watch.  I think they should either shorten the band a bit, or change how the buckle works.  I looked at those other \"first time\" watches with the fabric bands.  Thought those were velcro, but they don't appear to be.  Maybe Santa will bring another one of these.  I'll just have to modify the band a little."},

It shouldn't have been that large on the tightest attatchment. However, that alone is not my reason for a one star review. If I was able to give a zero star review I would. 3 hours after I gave it to her she dropped it two feet onto the kitchen floor and it shattered into pieces that cannot be put back together.

This wasn't an issue for us because we were giving it as a gift to our 6 year old for her birthday so she didn't care, but for someone who is giving it as a gift it might seem a little tacky to give it in a box that isn't made for it.  It also came running, which may be standard but I thought it was odd.  Who knows how long the battery has already been going now.  The watch itself seems great, though.  It fits my 6 year old perfectly and it fit me, too."},

It's got a pink hour hand, which matches with the pink hours printed on the watch face, and a purple minute hand, which matches with the 0-60 minutes printed on the watch face. She just matches them up (pink hour hand goes with pink numbers, purple minute hand goes with purple numbers) and she knows the time."},

She absolutely loves how the second hand is a butterfly that \"flies\" around the clock.  The band is comfortable and adjustable, and the watch can be removed easily over your hand since it's stretchy.  The only thing we don't like about this watch is that the band loosens on its own, and she has to pull it tighter from time to time, which makes the loose end of the band stick out to the side.  Sometimes I tuck it back in for her, but she can't do that on her own.  My son had a boys' version of this same watch when hew as little, and he experienced the same thing, needing to tighten it often.  It still beats a buckling band for this age."},

The handles make it easy to take off and put on until his foot gets too big (hence the second pair).  The soles do wear down compared to a standard rubber boot but kids grow fast so that was not an issue.  The tradeoff to quick wear is that softness = comfort... the boots give against the foot and so feel more comfortable than a standard boot.  4 stars  because the sole could be tougher... both for the wear and keeping sharp sticks out.  We did have a close call towards the end of the boot's life. 4 year old stepped on a stick in the brush and it stuck into the boot, right between his toes. The sole was about half the original thickness at this time. Those old boots are still fine looking but due to the wear I don't think we will pass them down to the 2yr old."},

She loves them though so I let her play with them but not wear them cuz they make her walk funny since they\u2019re too big. But when they do fit eventually they seem like they\u2019ll be very comfortable. We\u2019re keeping them since they will fit eventually. But they do run true to size, maybe a half size small but definitely not more than that. I wish Crocs sold these in smaller sizes since most babies are walking long before their feet reach a size 6... Also the color Fushia is slightly darker than pictured."},

We love how lightweight they are compared to traditional gumboots.  She uses them for both rainy days at preschool (they go out in all weather) and at home for tending to the urban chicken coop. We knew from experience that while the length is good or even a bit larger for size, the ankle can be narrow. As long as our daughter wears socks, she doesn't notice but there's been a few days when she's removed socks and complained of how they rubbed.  Never kept her from wearing them though. Love the easy handles and the ability to spray them off when the hoze (inside and out) without damaging them one bit. We gifted our old pair to a friend after she outgrew them and despite having two years of wear before that, our friend would have never known the difference. Good durability!"},

My kid loved these so much he actually wore them to bed the first night after he got them. He was so excited that he could put them on all by himself with the big handles to pull them on. At 2 years old doing things by yourself is a big deal. Worth every penny. He is able to walk fine and they appear comfortable. Sometimes pants are a little awkward with them as they don't always have room to tuck inside the boot and the pants aren't always wide enough to go on the outside (plus they would get wet and defeat the purpose) so they end up bunched up at the top. My kid doesn't seem to mind one bit. Best boots for jumping in puddles and mud. Easy to wash off inside and out. I've even put Crocs in the washing machine (though not these boots yet) and they come out squeaky clean. I will absolutely buy another pair when he outgrows these."},

My son barely even wore them because the weather has been nicer the last few months and he only wears them on rainy days. Today he came home from school with a huge split down the middle.  I have never had to deal with this from his or his sisters\u2019 previous Crocs handle it boots but now I am reconsidering what to buy next.  I guess the quality has gone downhill.

Right now his feet can get into them easily, will see how easy it will be to get them on when he is actually a size 6. I got the boots in yellow color and my child was very eager to wear these even when it wasn't\u200b raining and he looked comfortable with no rains and outside temp. in the 80s. He is a skinny kid so fitting in the calves is not an issue for him ( see pics for fit). Haven't tried these yet in torrential rains or even light rains but I am guessing it will be alright."},

I'm pretty sure that they don't offer a  lot of tactile feeling when she has them on because they are so thick (especially the small ones), but they suit the need and I'm glad they have thick soles since she is constantly running around in fields and near streams where there are rocks, roots, and branches.  She runs around in them (much too fast for my comfort), managing to keep her feet spread apart enough not to trip over the boots and then she will stop and look down at them--I guess she must think they are cute too.  Because of the way that the shoes are molded it is hard for my 16 month old to put them on by herself (which is totally legit) and also difficult for her to pull them off by herself (yay!)."},

They held up through several \"beatings\" as my son is VERY hard on shoes, the quality seems sturdy, and they SEEM comfortable enough.  He has pretty wide feet and these seemed to fit him well, so I almost reviewed that they were somewhat wide, but really, they were perfect for him.

It is a very nice looking watch. She has skinny hands and it fits well. The indiglo back lighting is something she loves. I thought she would prefer a 5-minute numbering (like, 5, 10, 15 etc) that appears in some other watches. But she quickly learned to tell the time (multiplied or memorized, I don't know) on a glance. The numbers are readable. The only issue is the strap - it becomes smelly after it gets soaked in sweat once. She will not wear when she plays outside or on a hot day. To be fair, this is not a sports watch however I expected the kids watch should be a little more versatile , so I am taking one star off.

They hold up well, there were barely any marks on them. She wears them weekly to dance class and also wore them for the recital.  The string is able to be pulled to adjust the fit around the foot, however loose or snug you would like them to fit which is great so they don't gap when in use. They are suppose to fit snug. She wears a 10 in sneakers and the 9 1/2m in the capezio daisy ballet shoe is actually a tiny bit roomy but not too much since they are supposed to fit like a glove. There is a small name tag in each shoe so you can write your child's name. I would definitely recommend this product.

For the size comparison in the 2T and the 3T, and with it being 100% cotton, I opted for the 3T and she should be able to wear it next winter, too! She loved putting her little hands in the pockets! The first thing she did, was find a toy to put in one of the pockets. She loved it so much, that she didn't want to take it off! It's not too bulky and heavy, so it should do just fine in a car seat.

This watch has been taken into a 3.5 foot pool for a couple of seconds, gotten wet in the shower for a short bit on 2 occasions, went through the wash cycle and dry cycle and it is still working with no problems! I was amazed! The seal has definitely been tested, although unintentionally, and it has stood up to our tests. I would recommend it if you need a good watch for the first time watch wearer.

And the elastic band is easy to adjust and snug enough to stay on during play but easy for my daughter to take off and put back on by herself when washing her hands, etc. My only regret is the minute numbers are too small to read easily, since the whole watch is sized to fit a little person. Not sure there's much they could do about that without making the watch too big. Note that this watch is designed to count how many minutes after the hour for the first 30 and then how many minutes before the next hour in the second half. If you prefer a more conventional watch that counts all the way from 0 to 60, Timex also offers that option. You just need to zoom in and carefully study the pictures of each watch."},

No matter how tight you pull it or how carefully you weave it through the little cinch loops, it does not hold.  20 minutes tops before everyone has to get on their hands and knees and look for it.

Life is grand with the little yellow boots."},

We ordered one size up so they will last a bit and they stay on no problem. They hold up great when walking in the stream and even over small rocks. They are easy for my son to pull on and we do not have to worry about the straps breaking off like we do with regular rain boots. Best of all, his feet stayed dry! We will definitely buy Crocs rain boots from now on!"},

No breathability, so her feet do sweat, but the best lightweight rain boot I have found and she loves to wear them. This is her second pair after growing out of the first (I ordered a 7 when she wore a 6 and it barely lasted the rainy season) and I intend to buy more as she grows!"},

Being so confused by the contradictory reviews, I opted to order the suggested size from Capezio. They are way too big! Going to order a 13.5 and hope for the best!

I noticed a lot of other reviews on here said that the fit was consistent, but because I'm somewhat skeptical and because I wanted these to fit through the spring, I went ahead and ordered a half size up from my toddler's street shoe size. FWIW, she has just barely started wearing a 9 in regular shoes, so I went with a 9.5, thinking that would give a little extra room but they wouldn't be too big. Turns out they are pretty much exactly the size of her foot, so if she grows much over the course of her pre-ballet class, I'll have to buy a new pair. I know it seems like everyone ordering these is having a different result as far as fit, so who knows. I'm not returning mine because I don't want to bother with it, but I would have preferred a full size up for them to fit the way I hoped they would. Good luck!"},

The strap os a super stretchy elastic with a metal piece on the back that you use to adjust the length of the strap. I don't think my daughter would be able to adjust it very well herself, but we just set it to the right size for her, and the elastic band is nice and stretchy so she can just stretch it out to fit over her hand to take it on and off.

It's totally cute, comfy, and easy to use.  She LOVES telling time on it, and will often ask me how long until something (when is dinner going to be ready) just so she can watch the clock and check her watch and ride my back about it.  It has helped her become more aware of time, and time-keeping.  I particularly like that it's analog and not digital at all; I feel well-rounded kids can do both, kind of like being able to drive stick or automatic.  ;)  The band is stretchy and adjustable, and where my daughter is really thin it slips around her wrist a little, but it's not bad.  She's gotten it wet, lost it, left it outside, and it's still in great condition.  Par for the Timex \"takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'\" course I guess.  Great product!  I can't wait to put a couple in my younger daughters' stockings for Christmas."},

So when they get completely muddy I wash them with soap and water and can dry them with a towel and they are ready to go! No waiting for the inside to dry out. The picture is after 6 months of almost daily wear (we live in the Pacific Northwest where it rains a lot!) and countless washings. They are awesome quality for the price.

The leather and soles are of course typical good Saucony quality, but they did not have a good shape to them like me and my husband's adult shoes. We will not be buying any more until they are regular lace-ups that I can try on him in the store (as I should have done first with these).

I was surprised with how large the watch seemed right out of the box but it is very easy to adjust the band to fit even the smallest wrist. The face is the perfect size for kids to see. The hands are labeled \"minutes\" and \"hours\" and of course the hours are marked around the face. The one complaint I have with the watch is that after you hit 30 on the minute labels, the minutes count down back down to zero so instead of saying \"35 past the hour\" they must read it as \"25 til the next hour\" -- not sure if this is the standard way of teaching time but we've had to adjust our thinking a little bit to help our 6 year old interpret the time after 30. Overall I am happy with the watch."},

It fits good on her small wrist (she is 7 and very slim).  The elastic feeds through a metal loop to allow for you to pull it tight, and she currently has it pulled tight enough that the elastic end has to be tucked under the entire length of the watch.  The band does get dirty very easily, but washes well too.

They were about 2 sizes too big. That being said, these are fantastic boots and exactly what I was looking for. Very low profile in the \"heel\" which is what drew me to these boots in the first place. I was surprised how hard it is to find rain boots without a lifted heal for young children! Each boot is made in one solid piece and no insert to be lost. They are wide at the toe like all Crocs fit, so they are perfect for layering socks but your child should still be able to pull them on and off independently. Very lightweight. Will definitely order again from this style if we need additional pairs."},

We just got my 3 year old son a pair to replace his rubber boots that were all cracked. He thinks they're great and it's nice for him to be able to put his own boots on without help!

Definitely size up at least a half to one full size. If your kid has wide feet like mine does, it may not be the best option for an all day shoe, but the Velcro straps are adjustable and very sturdy. It will just start looking a little silly if you loosen them too much! I'd rate these higher if they were true to size and a little more flexible.

I ordered a size 8 for my 2 year 4 month old son. They are a bit long in the toe, but narrow enough they hold on his feet well. They also close securely with the U-shaped hook-and-loop tab.

We just had my daughter's feet sized last weekend, so I felt confident ordering a size 12.5, as the shoe man told us she was between a 12 and a 12.5. When the shoes arrived, however, they were HUGE, at least a size too big. Thank goodness I have a Prime Membership so I was able to send them back for free, and the new shoes in a size 11.5 arrived in the mail two days later. These fit perfectly. I'm not sure what people are talking about with these being too small, but our experience was that they are about half size to a full size larger than street sizes."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "so glad I bought this", "review_body": "Before I bought this watch, I was always arguing with my daughter that it was bedtime & she would never believe me.  (She's 3.)  Same \"discussion\" for lunch, dinner, bathtime, etc.  She does well with the time timer, where she can see the literal amount of time she has until the next activity, so I realized she might need something to make the concept of time more real to her.  So, I had the bright idea to buy her a watch and help her understand that when the little hand points to 8, it's bedtime.  Or 12 for lunchtime, etc.  And, guess what...it worked!  No more arguing for me.  the elastic is stretchy & comfortable for her.  She can wear it all day & all night if I let her.  It's durable & and a wonderful price for a first watch that's sure to get lost eventually.  The watch has a little green hand that says \"hour\" and a big purple hand that says \"minutes\".  This, of course, is useless to her since she can't read.  It also divides up the face in minutes 0-30 and 30-60 to help children understand \"x minutes after\" or \"x minutes to.\"  But, as I said, we're not there yet.  Still, she loves her watch.  And now her 2 year old brother wants his own too.  It has made my life easier so I am happy to oblige."},

She wears this watch every single day and since she is 3, it gets beat up. But not only does it still work, but the band is still in really good condition. She has had this watch for several months now and I can safely say it was well worth the money spent. The band is stretchy, very easily adjusted and is very secure and stays in place. I would highly recommend this watch to anyone looking for a watch for an active little girl."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Nice watch with minor issues", "review_body": "This is a very nice watch, but it does have some disappointing feautres. The biggest problem is that the hash marks between the numbers and the small secondary numbers (i.e., 10, 25, 35 ...) are so small one can barely read them, so it'shard to tech my 5-yr old how to tell the time correctly, as far as a \"teaching\" watch goes. The second is that the wrist strap is elasticized, but has a cinch-tight metal loop mechanism that works on the underside, so it'shard for my 5-year old to tighten and loosen the strap properly - a more traditional buckle or other type of mechanism would work better. The third is that this watch has an INDIGLO feature, but it is much more dim than other TIMEX INDIGLO lights, and it's still hard to see the numbers when lit up - and the glo is purple, as are the numbers. My son has a sports ball version of this watch, which INDIGLOs in a bright yellow-green and really lights up and is easy to read. My little girl is disappointed in the dimness.

She thinks it is awesome that she can push a button and it lights up at night. She feels good that she can tell me the time when I ask her and is learning what \"quarter of 6\" means, or \"half past 3.\" I think these are valuable things to know that living in a digital age, we often overlook as being important for kids to learn. The only down side is that the face scratches easily. I wish Timex could make it more durable. I totally recommend this watch and am so happy we bought it.

The size of the watch was also perfect for her small wrist and as another reviewer noted, the $10 replacement option provided by Timex was comforting.

But I assure you, they are \"royal blue\" or \"bright blue\".

Also, within 3 hours of getting it I notices several permanent scratches on the face.

She is learning to tell time at school, and this is perfect to help her learn because it has the values for each number in small print (5, 10, 15, 20, etc.) right next to the big numbers.

The face has two sets of numbers (hours and minutes)and it makes it simple to read the time.  She is already a pro at telling time!  The wrist strap is a little goofy, but I doubt kids will mind. There is always a little extra material that kinda either binds up or flops around.  No biggie.  For 14 bucks I really don't mind.  You can't go wrong with this purchase for your 5 or 6 year old."},

She shows everyone her purple leopards and wears them almost daily.  This is a kid who only wore sneakers if prompted to before this pair.

My son wears a toddler size 6/7 an I bought 8 because the 6 that I had bought when my son wore size 5 became harder an harder to get in because of the leg part...

They were wearing sizes 6 and 7 respectively at age 2 when they grew out of them.  Bought them a pair of Hunters (for 55 bucks...) and they fell off their feet every single time they tried to go upstairs.  Or when I picked them up.  Or when they took a step that was slightly too high.  Sitting in a highchair at a restaurant?  You better believe they fell off.  Can't deny they looked cute as hell, on the rare occasion they weren't lying on the ground.  These were sized by a saleswoman at Nordstrom so I imagine they weren't the wrong size.  So I returned those and tried a pair of Oakiwear, same problem with the stairs, although to a lesser extent.  In those other brands the shaft just isn't curved at all  so they slip right out.  Which is pretty much the most annoying thing ever when you're trying to navigate a flight of stairs with a 2 year old on either side of you, who is now barefoot, screaming because her boot fell down the stairs.  Pretty sure I said some inappropriate words...Clearly crocs gets it.  These boots take a bit more effort to put on and take off, but that's how they manage to stay on the foot, which is kind of the whole point of a boot to begin with.  I imagine this would be less of a problem for kids with bigger feet."},

I bought her a size 10.5 wide which was a few sizes up from her size then and I'm glad I did because the strings pulled tight enough to bunch up the shoes for a snug fit and now can be worn more loosely now that she is a size 9.

First, the closing mechanism is the kind you find on some sports caps which require two hands for adjustments. This band requires that you take off the watch to change the size which is a hassle for anyone especially for children. That's bad enough but what makes it worse is that the closing mechanism is poorly made so it often doesn't lock properly.

I could be wrong, but I don't think that's normal. He has wide, thick feet, but I actually think there was plenty of room for his foot. Just too tight around his legs."},

These are very light and bend well when my son walks.

The bottom sole is a bit wider especially in toe area so less chance of slipping but not sure how would affect an older dancer with more need to turn, balance, etc. The leather was equally good quality on both. I preferred the bloch inner footbed better as it's a softer suede like piece and the capezio is more like thin canvas. Capezio ran smaller than Bloch. The capezio has shorter toe length so may be better for shorter wider feet and bloch better for longer, more narrow feet. The elastic band is nicer on capezio because it has a soft backing.

I ordered a wide, and our child's old shoes (Carter's) are still wider. So if your child has even a slightly wide foot or you're not sure, order the wide. The fit otherwise is as expected. I'd say these are great, casual wear shoes. But your kid's definitely not going to win any races that require a more athletic shoe while wearing them. If your child needs a true athletic shoe, I'm not sure that these really fit the bill. Our child has been wearing them the last 3 weeks and so far they seem durable. Will update if that changes."},

When unpacking them I saw that the box looked different from the first one and they had some small issues (a bit of glue visible on the trim of one, slight discoloration around the ties of the other). But these were just cosmetic and I was running out of time for a second return so I sent her to class with them. Today is only the 5th day of use and the inside of the sole is coming off!

His feet get super sweaty (to be expected of course) but so far I have no complaints.

They LOVE them and want to wear them all the time, but I imagine they will be outgrowing them long before they are actually a true size 7 toddler (the size of the boots).

She was 3 wearing a size 10 ballet shoe which she wore for 2 dance seasons. Her street shoe size was an 9, but when you tighten the strings it gives you a size down and gives you room to grow, plus it's leather so it will stretch as it softens. She's in an 11/12 street shoe now so we purchased an 11.5 ballet shoe and she has a thumb width and a good size of width. Once strings tightened they were perfect. Another option, like I saw others post, is to get them fitted at the store, but beware some dancewear stores will charge you a fitting fee if you do not purchase. My daughters dance teacher was spot on with her size. I will definitely be buying online again."},

The 10 fit just fine but I decided to keep the 11 as it would last longer. He walks just fine in them, not wobbling or walking out of them as he did with a brand that we tried previously. Not a lot of room to tuck pants but you can manage. Super light-weight and indeed waterproof. Everywhere we've been people have stopped us to ask where to get a pair for their kid.

They are very easy to rinse off when they get muddy.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because his first blue pair is cuter.  The first pair has the nautical- looking white grommets, instead of handle pulls at the sides on this pair. He has had his first pair for maybe 9 months and they are still looking great, so I expect these boots will perform similarly well.  After reading the reviews about the problems with the other kinds and brands of boots (heavy, stiff, narrow fit, sole splits from the body of the boot, liner can't get wet, child refuses to wear them), I chose to spend a little more on these and I haven't regretted it for a moment!"},

I read many reviews before I purchased and I decided to go with one and a half size larger due to experiences from other reviewers but it turned out that they are exactly 1- 1/2 sizes too big. However I did make a right decision to buy it Narrow because its \"Narrow\" is equal to \"Medium\" of regular shoes. I'll keep this Capezio for later use. I'll buy Capezio again for quality and price despite the size and width is hit or miss."},

I recommend it for anyone who wants their children to become confident in being able to tell time. In our house it was becoming a struggle to get our 9 year old to tell time so we got her this and all of the sudden she can look at a clock and figure it out! This watch played a huge part in that and gave her confidence."},

The only complaint we have is that the numbers for the seconds are really small, making it hard to read them. In a perfect world, those numbers would be a bit larger.  All in all, a great watch for a young one learning to tell time."},

The only downside is that the clasp is a bit tricky for younger kids to use.  The band is stretchy enough that if a parent gets the clasp right, the child shouldn't need to mess with it to get it on and off. However, if you have a kid that just likes to mess around with it anyway . . . it could be a little problematic."},

Though I know she still has a long way to go to fully understand the concept of time and the relationship between seconds, minutes and hours, I would say this watch did its job in helping her to  learn how to read time. I highly recommend it."},

She is small for her age and I was concerned that the band might not adjust small enough, but I was wrong, we adjusted the band to fit her perfectly but the fact that the band stretches makes it easy for her to put it on and remove it herself.  The color and the design was exactly as shown in the photo and she loved that it was ballet shoes.  Of all the gifts that she received for her birthday this was one of her absolute faves and I told her that she doesn't have to worry about getting it wet.  When I shared the cost with my family, they were shocked at the quality, I would compare the time piece to a $50 watch.  Highly recommend!"},

Also we parents have the tendency to buy shoes with an allowance, however when it comes to ballet shoes they must fit tight and in the case of my daughter though I would take a 9 if I want allowance, I stuck to her exact size 8.5 which aforementioned fitted."},

I found it harder than I thought it would be to find a watch that didn't look like a toy (power ranger or such) that would still fit a smaller wrist. This has a 40mm head, with attached plastic band that will fit smaller wrists (at least it fit a 10 yr old). I looks nice, seems pretty well built (time will tell) and is easy to set. It is water resistant but states not to press the buttons while under water. I like that it is both analog (uses hands) and digital. I'm not sure schools teach telling analog time anymore. The digital display is hard to read when the minute hand is between 5 and 7 as it covers the display.

His little buddies ask where he got it and most kids are into the look of the G-Shock watch but I am not sure about that G-suck price though.

I also have to put socks on my son for him to want to wear it because the the bottom is not smooth and my son didn't like how it feel without socks.  Other than that, it's easy for a 2 year old to put on, the color is cute and it feels very durable.  It also isn't heavy at all, which I was a little worried at first because of how heavy it \"looks\", but my son was able to jump in the puddles just fine.

We figure it will help her visually see when it's time for bed and to do homework and chores. So far it has worked well for us. She wears it all the time and especially to school. Now instead of getting antsy in class, wondering how much time she has left to do tasks, she can see for herself. I had no problems setting the watch when it arrived. It came with clear instructions and only took me about 2 minutes to set up for her. She has tiny wrists and I was surprised that it fit her. Interestingly enough, it even fit my adult wrist as well. The silicone band is strong, but soft and comfortable on the wrist. The watch is lightweight. My daughter is obsessed with the fact that at night, it not only lights up at the press of a button, but it cycles through a rainbow of colors before the light shuts itself off. You can set an alarm on it as well, which is also very easy to do. It shows day of the week above the time and under that ticks the seconds. Press and hold a button and it gives you the month and date. She loves it. We went on a family shopping trip after it came in the mail and during the entire trip she kept looking at it and reminding us what time it was. She slept with it on a few nights in a row and it's still going strong. There are a few dings in the front of it from who knows what (it didn't come that way, that was from my kids), but my daughter doesn't seem to care and it didn't effect the screen underneath at all."},

Of course, the ballet slippers are too big, so I probably should have gotten a 11.5.  That being said, I'd rather it be too big than too small and she will eventually grow into it.  My recommendation is don't buy children's shoes / ballet slippers online if possible.  Sizing is too difficult to determine online and it's probably best to have your child try them on before committing."},

It is quite lovely, the band is a flexible silicone, it would seem, and just yesterday we found out the newest excitement about the new watch: it lights up, with colors!

The straps keep them on the girls' feet but not too tight that they leave marks. They're actually a little large, which leaves room to grow into. The sides are a bit odd. Idk if it's b/c my girls needed size \"wide\" as they're a little thick for their height at this point, or if it's b/c the shoe is still a little larger size than they wear. Either way, they were bought to wear around the house, in their Christmas dresses & for dress-up. They love them & look adorable.

Stride Rites developed holes in the toe after 2 months, LL Beans (which I thought would be more durable) kept hurting his feet because of the sharp hard glue on the inside of the shoe.  These though, are easy to convince him to put on and get out the door.  They do fray after some time, but I haven't had any develop holes.

I've got 4 kids who work and play hard around our muddy farm and these boots will be handed down to all of them and then some....i'll never choose another brand for a rain boot for the kids again! I highly recommend these! Worth every cent! And, the kids love them. They're easy to put on and off and easy to clean off.  Perfect!"},

Our son is 16 months old, so we were concerned that he might have difficulty walking/running in these boots (many other rain boots proved to be too tall for him, thus making it difficult for him to walk comfortably). The Crocs proved to work like a charm. Our son is 33.5/34 inches tall and we ordered the size 7; he's had absolutely no difficulty walking in them. Please note: in other brands and shoe types (See Kai, Reebok, etc.), he is just transitioning from a size 5 to size 6, but after trying the size 6 in these, we realized that we needed to go up a size (the size 6 was too tight getting on/off and literally had no room for growth).

We purchased this watch (and the one in light blue) after reading the reviews and our own experience with the Timex brand.  This watch has more than exceeded their (and our) expectations.  The soft-buttery leather strap fits nicely around their wrists - it is not too big (they can wear it on the tightest fitting).  The watch face is large enough for them to read the time, altho' as young girls it doesn't appear to be too big in proportion to their body.  As well, second-hand has helped them learn more about time.  The Indiglo Light is a bonus for fun, altho' now they insist on wearing their watches to bed (even tho' they each have a digital alarm clock).  As well, the water-resistant feature is a plus because they still like to get messy and clean up on their own.  This is a great watch at an excellent price that I expect they will own for some time and will grow with each of them into their 'tween years."},

They are super easy for toddler to put on because the handle and the handle is very sturdy compared to other rain boots.  We had a pair of Fireman Western Chiefs and my son broke the handle very easily on those which is what prompted me to try these.  Because these are so durable, I will be able to pass these onto my daughter.

I measured my daughter's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested.  Her foot measures a little less than 6\", which would be between size 8 and 8.5.  I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still didn't fit!! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon.  The shoes itself only measure 5.75\" which is not what the sizing info states for size 9. Her big toes are curled up inside. So now, we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon, it's not their fault. Really cute shoes, but yeah, the sizing is like playing roulette, you never know what you would get!"},

There are small numbers at the edges reminding them that if the big hand is at 10, it is 50 minutes after the hour, etc.  They are comfortable, and inexpensive enough that the kids can wear them to school without worry.  They are NOT water proof, so need to be taken off before showering or swimming, but can endure almost all other activities.  My granddaughters wear theirs always and I believe it helped them to learn time quickly and painlessly.  The batteries are long lasting.

Some people purchase a size bigger or purchase the actual size and choose from the fit chart \"Somewhat large, small, fits as expected, etc\" for others to reference.  So I disregarded that chart and just read through a slew of reviews for this product.  Sooo... My daughter wears 10EE and I purchased size 11W in this shoe.  I purchased big so that she will grow into them.  The cinch at the top of the foot helps with the adjustment/width of the shoes for my daughter's feet.  She does have about 1/4 inch of room both at the ankle and her toes.  Her teacher mentioned that the cinch at the top is really what matters, so tighten the top or loosen the top for the feet and she will grow into the rest.  As I tighten the shoe with the strings at the top, it then becomes tight around her ankle so I have to loosen it there for her comfort.  She says it doesn't bother her, but for a child who is just passionate about ballet, she will comply to make her \"dreams\" come true.  So if a child says they fit fine and smiles, double check for your own peace of mind.  She is running around in them and dancing on our hardwood floors now, and the fit seems comfy for her.  She doesn't look like she's a duck with big feet either lol they don't flop.  hahahahahaha ok have a good day and happy hunting :)"},

But she opened it and was truly excited about it--she had to put it on right then, she loved the colors/design, and patiently listened while I explained how she could tell time with it.  Her mother said they are learning how to tell time in school, so this gift came at just the right time.  Yeah Grandma!!  I would definitely recommend this watch to others with a little girl in this age range."},

I bought Capezio taps following advice on reviews and the Capezio site to size and ended up with shoes that were just right to just too small. I can chalk that up to her growing while waiting for them to arrive. So I decided to order one size up on these as advised by reviewers and researched the measurements on the Capezio websites to ensure they would fit snuggly (as is neccesary with ballet slippers) and for longer than just a few weeks (kids grow like weeds at this age!). Yeeeeeeeeeeeh - they are literally an inch too long. I'm keeping them because she will inevitably grow into them and the quality is worth the money, but they are useless until then because ballet slippers must fit snugly to avoid injury & it's only the sizing that just blows. Not sure how to fix that other than more clear or specific sizing guidelines that match from either the manufacturer or diligently gathered by the seller. It's a shame."},

Most of the kids watches have plastic bands you buckle. Further, most bands are  too big, as she has the tiniest of arms. This watch has a stretchable cloth band that fits her perfectly and is easy to take on and off. All in all I am quite pleased with the product. It is a little pricey for a three year old, but if yours is as responsible as mine it is worth it. We created a treasure box in her dresser, where she keeps precious things that need to be safeguarded. So when she gets this watch it already has a safe home, when not on her wrist."},

I have also liked the indiglo function on Timex watches and this is no exception. The numbers are readable too.

The face is 23mm in diameter, so it is not too small, or too large for a small wrist. The fact that it is synthetic leather has not bothered me yet, either. Overall, I think this is cute, I love the indiglo and the price, and most of my friends were surprised when I said it was a children's watch! My only concern or dislike about this watch is that the band is still quite large on me. I wear this watch on the third most inner notch, and when originally expected to wear it on one of the most outer notches, being a children's watch. When I wear it, the tail end comes all the way up to the side of my wrist, but it is much better than being up by the face of the watch the way women's watches were fitting. Final note- if you have small wrists and like pink, this watch is the one for you!"},

Another plus is that a year later, when washed with clorox wipes and a magic eraser, they look almost exactly like the new pair that came in.

They fit perfectly! They are so light and soft - my son loves them; and he really is not a shoe person; as a matter of fact, he usually freaks out when I buy him new shoes. He's the type of a kid who gets used to one pair and will not wear another pair until I throw the first ones out. It's not the case with the crocs though, because as soon as they came in, he put them on all by himself and wanted to wear them that same day even though it was bedtime and not raining. They are perfect and cute. I really didn't expect it from a pair of rain boots. We will definitely go with the same brand for as long as we can."},

They are Very Light, especially compared to the typical toddler rain boots.  My son has no trouble walking in them.  He's got little fat feet and typically wears a wide shoes, so Crocs roomy fit worked well for him.  The big handles on the boot make it easy for him to put them on himself....an added plus.

After reading the reviews, I had no idea what size to buy, because some say buy a full size bigger, some say half size bigger, and Capezio says to start with the street shoe size. I just had my daughter's feet measured at Stride Rite less than a week before ordering these slippers. They measured her feet at a 9, so I bought her 9.5 shoes. Going with the size up recommendation, I ordered these in a 10.5. I didn't want them to be too small, and I wanted a little extra room so she could get more wear out of them. The length is fine, with a little extra room. However, the slippers seem quite wide (I ordered regular width, my daughter doesn't have narrow or wide feet). Even after tightening the strings (which did help quite a bit), there seems to be extra room. It's not enough of a problem for me to send them back; I think they'll work fine for her class. The quality does seem good, and the color was what I expected (ballet pink, not really pink). Overall, I'm happy with this purchase."},

The shoe itself is almost 1 inch wider and then the elastic band has a HUGE amount of strapping.  These are for extremely wide feet, not just little flintstone feet like my daughter has.

Here's why. Very strange fit: toe box is wide & boot is actually quite clunky-looking, but it's SO impossibly hard to get on!!! Harder than any rain boot I've ever seen. Part of that might be the grippy Crocs material, different than typical slick rubber boot material. I knew from reviews that these ran super-small, so when my toddler's foot was a sz. 4, I ordered sz. 6 for him and was pretty happy with the fit. He is a very tiny 23-month old (5%) with small, slender feet for his age. He's worn these boots for about 6-8 months and is just pushing into a sz. 5 now, so it's time to move up a size anyway, but these are just so hard to get on that I will never re-order. I'm back to traditional rain boots!! The pluses are that these are very lightweight, cute, kind of unique, and they do seem 100% waterproof because of the molded design (no real seams)."},

Our son is VERY active and these shoes can take the grunt of all things boy from dragging toes on a bike/scooter/etc. to getting crazy dirty in the mud.  LOVE how easy the one velcro feature was for him to put them on himself and take off.  For reference... our son had these when he was about 3 1/2 for 4 or 5 months.  We will be purchasing Saucony shoes again for both our kids."},

This seems to be true- he likes wearing them. They also fit closer to the leg than typical rain boots, which I think adds to the comfort.

We went up a whole size, and while the shoes were longer, they were IMPOSSIBLE to get on. I remembered one pair of these Capezios we had bought a year ago, and decided to purchase again, but in the wide width. The leather is so soft and supple, and they are not *too* wide, either. The drawstring gives a perfect fit. Also, the elastic is nice and wide and soft--doesn't bunch up into a painful rope across the foot like some brands do!

I will buy him a new pair of these again , he usually prefers sandals or nothing over a pair of gym shoes....not this pair though . These were the closest thing to a gold bar for him. I recommend these to anyone with toddlers, as well the adult gym shoes are great too! You cannot go wrong with this brand.

The velcro closure is easy and secure. My kid can now put them on by herself, which she loves to do. They last a long time, that is, until she outgrows them. And on top of all that they are SO CUTE. I love the bright purple version and this time wanted to try the yellow. I know it says \"boys\", but that's ridiculous. These are super cool KID shoes and both boys and girls can wear whatever color they want. The yellow color is very bright and she LOVES them.

Although it is quite cute and the watch works fine, I actually have a few complaints about it.  First, the letters and numbers are so small that I question how much the watch is 'teaching'.  My daughter is 7, so she has already learned basic time skills, so it works for her.  The reason I purchased the watch was the elastic band.  The idea was good, but the execution was just okay.  The watch has a buckle of sorts so you can adjust the band size, but nothing keeps the watch \"tightened\" when she wears it.  It is always slipping off as she wears it, so I am going to have to sew some Velcro into the watch to keep in in place."},

Way too wide, even pulling the strings tight, but I thought the length might not give her enough room to grow. Next I ordered a size 11M. Also way too big.

I guess that's to be expected, since they are Crocs, but all other rain boots are so heavy, these are lightweight and easy to run/walk in all day long. We had 2 pairs of the Croc Jaunt rain boots in the past, and they are virtually indestructible.  When my daughter outgrew them, they still looked brand new after months and months of heavy use.  When this style came out and it was time to size up again, I didn't hesitate (I really like the updated style without the holes in the side that the Jaunts had.) So far, we're thrilled with them."},

The wristband is easy to operate and has been dependable for us so far (we have had it for about a month); the band will loosen over time, so we do need to cinch it up occasionally.  The watch is attractive and keeps time accurately.  It ticks softly every second, which I think is a good way of learning about the passage of time.  There is a little flower that moves with the second hand -- very cute.  There are two rows of numbers around the watch -- one set of the 1 to 12 numbers and also an outer set of 5 to 60 (by fives).  This second set of numbers is what makes it so helpful for 'watch learners.'  I highly recommend it!"},

The typical rainboots you see at Wal-Mart or Target have a heavy sole and my son didn't like to wear them (he had a difficult time running around in them). After doing some research and going through the customer reviews I decided to go with these Croc rainboots. Anyone who knows me knows that I am not a Croc advocate as I think they are hideous (sorry, just my opinion) however, these rainboots are cute, simple, lightweight, durable, and perfect for wide-footed toddlers!! My son LOVES them. As another person has already mentioned about their child, my son never wants to take them off! They are super easy for him to get on as well. I would recommend these rainboots to anyone and plan on getting them for my daughter when she starts walking as well. Great buy!"},

I don't think they'll fit her next year but the size 9 was over 1 inch too large.  My 2 year old wears these all day long.  I would suggest wearing socks for a few days to break them in and to prevent blisters.  My 8 year old wears a size 1 so I bought a size 3 for her.  They are huge on her and I probably should have exchanged them for a size 2 but she does like them and they don't make her feet look overly large.

When I got to the store I noticed the boots weren't lined with a chafe resistant fabric like most rain boots I've seen and figured that if put my daughter in with no socks or socks that don't give her complete coverage that obviously the friction between her skin and boot would cause issues. So what I did was put on thick knee high socks and long pants over her socks so that there was enough cotton cushioning between her and the boot and no chance of skin contact. After 3 hours playing at a farm I took the boots off and sure enough there were blisters beginning to form just underneath her inner ankle bone on both feet. I think these boots are adorable and my 2 year old daughter loves them but in my opinion they aren't meant to be worn for hours of play. Just from point a to point b. Maybe a little longer."},

It isn't Velcro and it isn't a clip - rather it's a metal clasp that holds the strap together.  Basically this is now a slip-on watch. Adjust it once, then slip it on and off.  Two. The hands on the face.  It does have a seconds hand to show seconds, but includes a ill-placed butterfly 45 degrees off of it.  For a child learning to tell time, seeing 4 hands versus two or three is incredibly confusing.  Lose the butterfly! It's not necessary and makes teaching kids to tell time that much harder.

However, having bought a lot of these over the years, it's not my favorite.  First, the band is not velcro but rather a single loop buckle.  It is not secure and keeps slipping out.  I can't figure out why Timex didn't just use a velcro loop here like their other watches.  Also, the second hand has a little butterfly which follows it around.  The butterfly is so big it can easily obscure the hour hand.  For a kid learning to tell time, this is a constant distraction.  Every 45 seconds you can't see the hour hand.  Adults can figure it out, but little kids?  Also, the minute labelings are a good idea, but are impossibly small and hard to read."},

The latch also makes it pretty difficult to put on with one hand for a 7yrs old. I had difficulties putting it on for her because of that closure, not sure why wouldn't it have been made with the regular way to secure other watches. My daughter also liked the watch, had her reading time within the 1st hrs of trying it on. Because of the end result after just one wear, she didn't even look at it this morning to put on.

We went through an entire season without any issues. This season, I realized that sharp sticks or a nail : ( can go through the bottoms fairly easily and make them not waterproof anymore. Just something to consider as you're looking for footwear. Overall though, these have been great boots.

Doesn't hurt to get them to learn earlier, right? The design is very cute, but best of all, it is very practical for learning how to tell time. She is not yet able to add on counting when the minute hand is not exactly on a face number like 3 or 6, but at least she can tell time to the closest time. I strongly feel that getting kids a face watch to learn to tell time is much better than getting them a digital watch until they learn how to tell time using a face watch. The design is also cool enough to wear as she grows older. I deducted a point only because the face of the watch is plastic and it scratches very easily.

I was sceptical of the elastic band at first, but in reality, it makes the watch extremely comfortable. My daughter only takes her watch off to bathe. Even then, she forgets to take it off occasionally and the water resistance has worked perfectly. The band has gotten kind of fuzzed up and doesn't look as nice as it once did, but it is a small price to pay for a watch much loved by its owner.

I could see my 20-month having trouble running around in them. Also, they can be hosed off after playing in the mud and rain. Another thing is that they fit well but are still easy to put on. I have rain boots that will come off when you get stuck in mud. Not these! Since they are so easy to put on, I can set them up and my 20-month can out them on herself.

Then, we felt how stiff they are when you are trying to get them on. I thought I could \"break them in\" for a couple of days by working to stretch out the hole that your foot goes in, but this was a waste of time. This shoe is so stiff that my daughter can't even put it on without hurting her fingers as she's trying to get the shoe on. Once the shoe is on, it's fits well and is comfortable. However, I will never buy this brand of shoe again due to the difficulty of actually getting it on."},

I noted from other reviews that they run a little small, so I ordered the 10.5W and it was the same length as another shoe that I ordered in size 10, which is exactly what I was hoping for. My son is not quite 3, so he immediately jumped into a puddle with them. We washed and dried them with no issues. I will likely buy another pair of the same shoes in the next size up, since it's so hard to find wide shoes for little guys."},

My child is 50 percentile in weight and height so I never thought this would be even close to an issue.  Maybe he has tall or thick feet. Buying the W instead of the M may be the way to go."},

{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Size Chart is WRONG", "review_body": "My 3 year old daughter wears a size 7 in toddler shoes.  Because of my years of dance, I know that ballet shoe sizes are usually not the same as street shoe sizes.  We don't have a dance store within an hour driving distance from our home, so I had to order all of her dance supplies online.  Because of this, I measured her foot 3 times to make sure that I got the correct measurement.  Both feet were just under 5.5 inches long.  When I looked at the size chart for this shoe, the length of her foot matched with a size 7.  I know that some brands have converted their sizes to match street shoe sizes, so I thought that maybe Capezio had done the same.  Wanting to be on the safe side, I ordered a half size bigger - a 7.5, thinking she'd grow into them if they were too big.  When they came, I could NOT believe it.  There is NO WAY that someone with a 5.5 inch long foot could wear a size 7.5.  Absolutely NO WAY.  I'd say that she probably could have fit her foot in a 7.5 back when she was wearing a street size 4.  That is a BIG difference.  She was so disappointed, and so was I.  It would cost almost $6 just to return them, even though they shipped for free and weigh almost nothing, so I have kept them for my younger daughter to grow into.  Now I'm trying to find the time to drive 2 hours to the nearest dance store to get her a pair that actually fits since there is no way to tell for sure what size she is based on the size guide provided."},

We like this style of these shoes and I always spare time to clean the white bottom rubber area and around the sides of the shoes every after use since he plays a lot around the sand in the playground. I use a toothbrush to scrub the dirt and upon washing the red shoes bleeds out red stains coming from the suede part everytime I wash the soap off. The red suede part however is starting lose it's vibrant red color leaving it paler than first use. The middle upper part of the shoes began to wrinkle after second use thus losing it's tautness. The velcro strap does run short. My son has narrow and long feet and when I close the velcro, sometimes it cuts short so I have to pull it again to tighten just to properly close both velcro ends. Not helpful for toddlers with wide and chubby feet I guess. It will probably unsnap. It is however durable and flexible. It has that old school classic design which I love. Other than the color bleeding out and the suede fading off while surface cleaning the sides and the short velcro closure, we still love this pair. Consider sizing up a little bit."},

The length of the shoe new was exactly the same as a carter size 4 crib shoe but the heel fills out the back and you can't tell by simply looking at a pic like some people post. I do feel my daughters size would never have worked and maybe a 1/2 size up may barely just fit and by the time she stretched them she would be grown up a size anyway.

Love the quality and construction, not the cheap sticky pleather you see on discount shoe store versions.  I'm glad I ignored the comments about sizing and ordered her street shoe size, 9.5M.  It fit just fine in width and is actually a little long in length.  My assumption is that many of the reviewers saying to size up 1-2 sizes may have their children in the wrong size street shoe to begin wtih.  Take the time to get measured professionally (not by any part time kid with a slide measure in a big-box shoe store) and you'll rarely get it wrong.  On the other hand, this shoe doesn't fit like a ballet shoe \"should\" - tight and fitted to the foot - but my daughter has plenty of room to grow and being in pre-ballet the form fitted shoe is probably unimportant."},

I purchased a 6, 6.5, and 7 to compare. We will be keeping the 7 as it is comfortable and she has room to grow.

My daughter (17 months) can easily pull it off, which would be good for older kids learning to put on their own shoes, but for my little one, it's kind of a drag because she's always taking them off in the car (which she does with all her shoes for whatever reason - when we are at home she wants them ON all the time).

I looked on dancedepot.com to find Capezio's size chart:  [...]  According to that chart, style 205 (this shoe) is one of the ones that runs comparable to street size.  Best bet is still to measure your child's foot anyway.  Might I STRONGLY recommend going to a shoe store so they can do it with their magical slidey foot scale.  It's *made* for measuring feet for shoes (unlike the tape measure in your sewing kit).  Besides, if your (3-5 year old) is like mine, they'd much rather play along with the nice shoe store salesperson than Mama (eyes roll)..."},

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Standard, but nice.", "review_body": "Since my daughter started dance over a year ago I have tried 3 different ballet shoes (4 if you count the Danskin slippers we bought until her actual ballet shoes came in) Her first shoes were the Bloch Bunnyhops, those were amazing. They have more of a bubblegum pink than the Capezios which are genuine \"ballet pink\" which is more of a peachy hue. These Capezio Daisy's were her 2nd real pair of ballet shoes. For the price, they're great. They fit about right on for us. They're your standard, nice, ballet shoes. The daisies on the inside of the shoe are cute for girly girls. The strap on the top is wide and I'd assume its more comfortable. They have a split sole, which helps with flexability. The only thing that annoyed me? The drawstring is so long and they come undone and I have to double tie them. So.....now that she has grown out of her Daisy's, her new shoes are the Capezio Love Flat. They don't have the drawstring ties on the front. They have some mesh on the bottom though so don't look as \"clasical\" as the Daisy's. My verdict is that these Capezio Daisy ballet shoes are the most standard and classic shoes that you can get for your daughter. If you like more of the classic ballerina look, go with these."},

But for the Daisy 205, my daughter is a size 9 street shoe and I bought these in a 9M and they fit.  They don't have much growing room but from what I read ballet shoes are not supposed to be too big.  I was worried though so instead of saving $4 by ordering here on Amazon and being stuck with a size that doesn't fit, I ordered elsewhere, paid a few dollars more, but had free return shipping if they didn't fit.  That would be my suggestion if you are worried about sizing.  I have a feeling it will cost more than $4 to return ship them if they don't fit. I hope this helps others."},
