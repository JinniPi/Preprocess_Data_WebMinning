The collars have stood up very well, even when faced with some curious goat nibbles. They are showing a little dirt, but after 5 months in a goat pen, I think they still look pretty great. I'm back to order the 1\" size as the girls have grown large enough. For the record, Harriet (Tubman) is wearing the blue collar and Ruth (Bader Ginsburg) is sporting the pink one!"},

I bought the medium and tightened it all the way when he was smaller (~20-25bs) and it fit well.  Fast forward to today, hes 55lbs and it's been loosened about half way and still has room for him to grow.  It's held up very well between him always getting wet (if there's water to play in, he finds it), rough housing at the dog park, and recently the beach; it hasn't faded and the color hasn't bled.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy again and would highly recommend this collar."},

He was in a ridiculous low quality petsmart collar that was a size medium when we first adopted him at 5 months old (he is a little over 6 months now). It didn't fit at all. I'm not sure why he was in a collar that size. Anyway these Blueberry (I was pleasantly surprised they don't only come in the color blue) collars looked nice so my fianc\u00e9 and I were like, why not, let's buy our dog a collar that isn't crap because we love our fluffy brat baby dog and want him in a collar that fits him. After engaging in a brief dispute about collar colors because my boyfriend still sometimes tries to push gender roles onto our two male dogs (it's 2017, wake up babe), we settled on the color emerald in a size small. Now, we are both satisfied about the aesthetics of the collar, I'm satisfied that my boyfriend is becoming more progressive, and most importantly it is the correct size and high quality.

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Collar constantly comes loose", "review_body": "This collar is okay. I've had it for about a year and I hesitate to give it three stars. If I were using this collar solely for the purpose of holding my dog's tags then it would serve its purpose just fine. It is cute and holds up well, though it picks up dirt and discolors easily (I own the light mint color). However, the type of material it's made from means that when used with a leash the collar will loosen quite often, even with only minor tugging. My dog doesn't yank or tug when we walk, but just from normal leash usage I have to check the collar daily to make sure that it's fit properly around her neck. Even then, my dog has still slipped out of it on a walk three times now when it was loose and I didn't realize it. Thankfully she just was distracted and stays easily by my side, but I see this as an issue when the collar loosens so frequently. This could be a safety hazard for dogs who may run into the street or who aren't trained to come right back to their owners. I don't believe I would purchase this again in the future."},

I plan on coming back for the matching leash! The quality feels very sturdy, and the color is beautiful. She's a blue merle cockapoo and it's hard finding blue stuff that doesn't make people assume she's a boy. I also upgraded her dog tag which I also purchased on Amazon just in case anyone was wondering :) I'll post some pics! I hope this helps!"},

Salt water is notoriously hard on a lot of materials, but this collar seems to be strong enough to stand up to that, Joey's rolling in the sand, and his many walks on the leash. Adjusting the size of this collar is a little difficult, but I was able to make it a little bigger than it was when it arrived. The dark orchid color is bright and a beautiful jewel tone, and most of the parts (clasp, buckles, etc.) are a sturdy but flexible plastic. The only metal is the loop for the leash and/or license/ID/ rabies tags. Joey is an Aussie and about 40 pounds and I bought the medium-size - it seems to be fine. So far I'm very happy with it!"},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "All sizes cost almost the same", "review_body": "Ended up being smaller than expected and too small for my foster dogs. I probably should have double checked the size chart. I feel these are a little overpriced for the smaller collars as well, and they are almost as much as the larger sizes cost. I buy most of my small dog collars for $3 or less usually. These are slightly nicer than what I buy, but a six dollar jump for a similar product is still a lot. The colors are cute though, and the variety is nice. The lavender I purchased is a pretty color. If you're looking for a more unique color, then that is mostly what you will be paying more for.  If I need a larger size, I might buy this brand again. Otherwise, I will keep buying the other brand I've been using."},

Pup is a lab/shepherd mix, five months old and 35 lbs; with expectation to about double in size.  We got the collar before we could measure and went with a medium based on photos of the pup (he was a rescue from another state).  It fits him perfectly and likely will up to adulthood as well.  Blueberry Pet collars tend to have a lot of adjustability in them."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "Quality Issue", "review_body": "Returned this as it was defective. Was pleased to get the item on time and seemingly exactly as I wanted.  But then I went to adjust the collar to the length needed.  As I did so, I found that the plastic \"slider\" that holds the end of the material and slides along the collar to adjust the length was broken. The black plastic is split at the bottom.  It looks like a design problem:  The slider width is too small to handle the bulk of the collar material.  That, combined with brittle plastic seems to make the piece break even without any of the lateral pressure that it would face once it was pulled flat and actually put on the dog.  For this reason I did not ask for a replacement."},

BUT he has a very large, thick neck and this fit him very well.  The color is hard to describe because it was so bright and brilliant. It is like a lime green. Very, very nice. After purchasing this collar for him, I actually ordered another printed collar from blueberry pet for another of my dogs. I can't say enough about how nice these collars are!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Nice!", "review_body": "Love these collars!  We got the marine blue embroidered with black font for our gorgeous, red American Bulldog, Rusty.  He looks so dapper in his new blue collar!  Had originally considered going with leather, but these nylon collars seem hold up well to the punishment they receive.  We had bought him a weatherproof blue collar with a metal name plate.  It was adequate, but didn't last that long.  The name plate came loose and he completely dislodged it.  He's had an embroidered collar in the past and it seemed to work pretty well, so we thought we'd give this one a try.  We LOVE the wide selection of available colors.  They offer a lot of choices and not just a few basic colors.  We also feel a little more secure knowing the name plate can't be dislodged or lost this time.  We may go ahead and order for our other dogs as well."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Good looking quality collar", "review_body": "Very nice looking.  Has a little bit of a sheen to it which makes it pretty.  I like the thickness of the material and the width of it.  I like that it clicks together.  Our last leash didn't and we almost couldn't get it off when she outgrew it!  The only thing I don't like (took off 1 star, besides the fact that we've only had it a week so far)  is that the rubber tag that says \"Blueberry\" on it is right in the way of where I need to tighten it to.  The rubber tag can actually feed through, but I don't want to leave it inside the buckle as it seems like it may be too thick and wear it out.  If I pull the tag all the way through it is slightly too tight.  Instead, I just cinched it right up to the tag and left it there, slightly too loose.  Slightly annoying, but I do love this collar so far!  Very classy and seems to be awesome quality."},

We always buy a small dog collar but this one was a little too big. This wasn\u2019t the company\u2019s fault which is why I still gave this 5 stars.. it was my fault for buying a collar online being that it\u2019s for a cat. I had a hard time finding the shade of purple for his collar and when I found this.. I HAD to purchase it. My cat still wears this collar even though it\u2019s a little big... there\u2019s no choking hazard so it\u2019s all good. The quality of this collar is awesome.. it\u2019s so thick and durable and I love the color it\u2019s so vibrant! He\u2019s a brown/black tiger cat.. so you can see it really good!

She always wants to sit in my lap while I drive and/or try to sit on my shoulders... I've never seen another dog try to wrap its body around one's shoulders like a scarf and as funny as it is, it's really dangerous. I paid $10 for a red Blueberry car seat strap for the dog and it works perfectly in my 2018 Honda Civic. I click it in the back seat and have it adjusted so she can reach both windows, but not the front and she still has plenty of room. I attach it to her with a padded harness for extra protection. No worrying about her jumping out of the window, being thrown out through the windshield in an accident, changing gears, or distracting me. I think it's a great product. I'll buy Blueberry again for sure, the color is really vibrant."},

It\u2019s true to size, and easy to adjust the right neck size of your dog.  I ordered the Royal blue color and I think it looks classy on my dog, and has held up well despite him rolling in the mud. I bought this one because our old one was literally falling apart (a different brand), and so far it seems very durable and easy to keep clean. It feels very secure with heavy duty buckles and a sturdy D ring. The old collar would drive me nuts when it got dirty because it would show every spec of dirt on it, but that is not so with this Burberrys collar. It also seems very tough and durable, which is great when you have a stubborn 75 pound dog that likes to walk you instead of being walked. I got the large size which fits him perfectly. The Burberry tag on it is very unobtrusive if you don\u2019t like it, but I think it looks great, you could also take a seam ripper to it if you hate it that much, but I wouldn\u2019t bother."},

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Great colors, druable, yes names are covered slightly...but get over it", "review_body": "I ordered three of these collars a while back, for 3 chihuahuas. The collar in itself is a very durable sturdy collar, that seems it will do its job well over time. The colors we choose were great and the color combination with the thread can totally make it your own. The colors are true both in collars and the thread for the stitching. It is noted heavily that the placement of the stitching is off and therefore when adjusted you cannot fully read it anymore. Well my 3 dogs all go small collars, but they all have different neck sizes (we have a thin guy, a fat guy, and a girl thats in between) so all of their adjusted sizes are different, and all have the adjustment piece covering some part of their name/number. The point being, no matter where the embroidery, when adjusted the name may be covered. So I do not think that this is something that the seller can fix unless they know your dogs true neck size and adjust it before stitching which is a crazy thing to ask for. Anyways these collars will get the job done, if your pet gets lost, the person can remove the collar to fully read the name, which is better than no name or number on your pet at all!"},

The colors are gorgeous and the collars are sturdy and well made, but there's no way they will adjust down to 18 inches. If you leave the rubber label in place, you can get the collar down to 20 1/2 inches, but no less. The label is stitched on and easily removed, not what the manufacturer had in mind, I'm sure, but without the label you can get the size down to 19 inches. At 19 inches, you run into the doubled braid and stitching that holds the clasp and ring in place, which won't fit through the buckle. My pups will grow into these collars, and they are really nice collars, they just can't adjust as small as the ad copy says."},

I ordered a small because the inches matched and there seemed to be room for the writing, also, I wanted it to be a bit thinner to be more comfortable. Its perfect.

If the text was left centered (where the company logo is) it would be better. It's also bulkier than I was expecting; the buckle never really lays correctly and sticks out.

These treats are a good size for a large breed puppy as they are about 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch big. For smaller breed dogs that average about 2-5 pounds during early puppyhood when you are potty training and teaching basic commands/tricks, they are much too large. I cut the treats with scissors yielding four smaller treats and those are perfect for smaller mouths! Not only are they more palatable at that size but you can get a longer training session in without your pup getting full and ruining their dinner. I wonder if the number of negative reviews about diarrhea and tummy upset in their pup from these treats is because they were feeding too many or too large of pieces for their dog? Our pup is about 3 pounds currently and we typically do one to two short training sessions a day with her as well as reward occasionally for proper pottying using these treats giving her on average 8-12 bite sized, or 2-3 full size, treats a day.

I break each one in half before I give them to him in hopes of making them last longer, as I think he would eat the whole bag if I let him. My only wish is that they put more in the bags. If you're only giving them 4-6 of them daily, they may last a wk. But, it's been a tried & true love for my Luke, who's been enjoying them since his teeth started really coming in.

I usually break them into quarters and give her 2-3 treats. I LOVE that they are MADE IN USA, as I refuse to give her treats made in China. I also like that these treats have no wheat, corn, soy, meat by-product, dairy, or artificial colors or flavors! I think these are really great and really wish I had discovered them earlier. I'm very picky about what I give my little girl.

So when I brought it back out later she started dancing and twirling around like a little circus dog. I was very surprised to see our usually laid-back little lazy puppy display so much excitement over a little treat. From then on it has been her favorite treat and we have been using it exclusively for potty training and sitting commands. She has come to know the yellow color of the package every time we bring it out then lazy little Ramona gets up and starts dancing around sniffing the air displaying an unusual amount of excitement for her beloved treat.

He'd been mowing lawn, didn't see the neon green collar laying in the green grass and hit it with the mower.  Now, I have no idea how the collar got off the dog. Since it was pretty chewed up after going through the mower, I couldn't tell what happened for sure.  I'm assuming, though, that the buckle failed as the collar material itself is much too strong to break and I'm pretty sure it wasn't cut.  The other possibility is the locking slide moved, the collar size enlarged enough to slip over this dog's LARGE head.  Neither possibility is good.  A failing buckle is never good, a failing lock slide (that little plastic piece that is supposed to prevent the collar from changing size on its own) is even WORSE.  It's one thing to have the collar enlarge so it falls off.  It's quite another to have it shorten and choke your dog!  For this reason, I've changed my original 4 star rating to 3."},

Every time the puppy uses the training pads to pee or poop, I praise it afterwards and give it a small piece of the treat.  If your puppy is very young, break the treat and give it a tiny piece, not the whole piece because the tiny puppy needs to adjust to its diet.  When I first gave my puppy the treat, it had diarrhea.  So I stopped giving it and then after a few days, I would give it only a very small part of the treat and it is fine.  The idea is that the puppy gets a reward for potty training, so even if the treat is a tiny piece as long as the puppy can taste it, its good.  When the puppy gets bigger and has better digestive system, you can give it more treats and in whole pieces.  I break one whole piece into 4 or 5 very small pieces.  My chihuahua puppy has adjusted to it and it no longer has soft stool or diarrhea from this treat. It absolutely love this treat and will go crazy happy over this treat.  Also, i find it beneficial to my puppy's digestive system to give it a tiny bit of greek yogurt (the non-fat low sugar kind) and the puppy loves the greek yogurt (i give like half teaspoon, very little)."},

If I try tightening the collar all they way, the collar would be ok, but tighter than I want, and the label still would be stuck in the adjuster buckle.

I really can not handle it.  My husband scolds me for giving her too many of these things but I can not help it!  The pup loves these things.  It's like crack for her.  She will constantly beg for these treats, and this is the only way we can get her to do any tricks at all.  It is always a mystery what is in dog food, but this product seems like it has good nutrients for my pup.  We used this to effective train her to go potty on a mat inside, and when she got her appropriate shots, for her to go outside.  It is also perfect for puppies because they are nice and soft.  Our puppy had a hard time chewing kibble because her little teeth could not handle the hard kibble.  So it was nice to find a treat that she does not have to work too hard to chew.  She really craves these things.  We also were having a hard time getting her to eat her kibble recently, so we would bury these little treats into her kibble and that helped her eat her kibble for a while.  But...I think that stopped working because she just wants to eat the kibble now.  I guess we should cut back on giving her these treats."},

He looooves these little treats and they are really soft and he has no trouble chewing them. it may be that he is a small breed and so they are easier for him with being soft.

I should mention that I've never bought dog treats before so I don't have a basis for comparison. I tear these into halves or quarters with my hands since he is still small and I don't want to overfeed him. He is motivated by them in low-distraction environments but not in high-distraction ones (where real meat is more effective). He has some trouble chewing them (sometimes they fall out of his mouth and he has trouble finding them), so I kind of wish I had bought the crunchy ones, but it is nice to be able to break them into smaller pieces easily. He also just seems to prefer hard/crunchy things in general."},

However, when he had a taste of other meatier, and I suppose tastier, treats, he was not so much a fan of these treats anymore. Definitely use them when your pup is young and new to treats or if you do not plan on introducing any other treats for the time being. I did appreciate that the treats do not crumble as they are very moist and were easy to use in training sessions. My dog currently goes nuts for anything stinky and/or meaty -- fish skins, lamb lung, liver treats, wet dog food, deli meats, etc. -- definitely considers those to be high value treats. These soft puppy bites would be adequate as low value treats for a young puppy not yet exposed to higher value treats. Good luck!"},

It took me nearly three months to house break my Standard compared to less than two weeks for my Miniature. He receives this treat when he urinates outside and another (expensive) treat for his poop in order to understand the difference between the two in addition to preventing him from \"eating the same ol' cracker for both actions\".
