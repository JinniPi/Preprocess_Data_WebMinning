Call me old fashioned, but for that price I'd like to see my item arrive in primo condition. One pad has a big scratch on the screen, which will likely not affect function so much as it's unsightly. Second, the paper is wavy and wrinkled. Were I the young artist, I'd want my materials to be spanking new, no scratches, and flat beautiful art paper."},

Oddly enough, the one they sent me to replace it was different than this one, so I'm not sure if this is a knockoff product or what, but it was AWFUL.  First, the switch was stuck in the \"OFF\" position, but when you put the batteries in, the light came on.  SInce the switch was stuck in off (and I mean stuck....like it didn't move AT ALL...I don't even know if it could move) you could not turn the light off...it was just permanently on.  Then, there were these +/- buttons at the top that I have no idea what they were for because you couldn't push them.  It's like this whole thing was fake.  Fake buttons, fake switch...the only thing that worked was the light and I was not about to take batteries in and out every time my daughter wanted to use it.  I called Crayola, they asked me to send it back to them and they sent me a replacement.....but the replacement looked COMPLETELY different.  The function was the same, but there was no weird buttons at the top and the switch was a better quality switch in the back, not on the top.  Again, I don't know if this is some knock off product or what, but BUYER BEWARE.  If you want the ACTUAL, QUALITY product, go through Crayola or buy from an actual store so you can see what it is you are buying."},

The price on this product fluctuates quite a bit so keep it in your cart for a bit and watch it - when it dips under $7 I stock up.  This is a nice heavy weight, with light texturing to it.  I like this large size because I can cut it in half or quarter it and the kids still have a nice size surface to work with.  I am puzzled at the poor reviews.  To be fair, we don't super soak/saturate the paper normally.  But it does NOT dull colors and it does NOT pile on us.  Perhaps that's because my children aren't using any advanced techniques on the paper.  I have worked with Strathmore paper before and did not find it noticeably different in how much it warps or how it absorbs color, but again - we are novice painters.  :)"},

I should have paid attention to the other reviewers for this pad. Yes, you get 30 sheets of paper, but they're virtually unusable for wet-in-wet and lifting techniques (both of which are vital to me!). This stuff disintegrates the second you so much as brush up against it with a qtip, and you can forget about incorporating lots of beautiful, watery layers. Guess I got what I paid for."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great for Kids!", "review_body": "This is really nice, heavy paper, at an incredible price. This is my favorite painting paper for my toddler.

She has literally glued marbles to this stuff and it holds up fine."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Great for testing, not so much for finished work", "review_body": "For the price, this is a great buy. Unless you're a kid or using it for practice sheets, it might not be worth it though. It buckles a ton. I've compared it to Arches, and the amount of buckling is about four times what Arches will do when taped down and with the same amount of water applied. Also, when peeling the tape back up, it pulls some of the paper up with it. Not so Arches. I will say though that if you keep your piece taped down until the piece is fully dried, the buckling mostly settles down. In the meantime though, your paint will have settled into certain areas you maybe didn't mean of for it to. If you want that spontaneity, great. If not, well, you get the idea."},

Now it is a translucent beautiful glowing cover - front and back, and now I'm working on the inside. Each page is thicker, feels like 80#? and takes water color well as long as you don't completely drench the paper. Go easy and the paints will blend and run and it's beautiful. I've used some light coating of joint compound through stencils and let it dry, applied gesso and paints, inks, let it all dry, then more mod podge - these pages take it and then some.

Works very nicely with pencil, slightly rough textured paper will make lighter applications of pencil appear grainy.  Nice with most watercolour markers although thirsty.

It's fun to use markers and pencils on but it's also really awesome for watercolor  (it warps) too. I have watercolor paintings on both sides of the paper and both are fine. I always do a small test if I'm going to do back AND front though. I love the spiral, I love the 7x10 size, and I love the durability of the paper. I wish I didn't HAVE to put washi tape on the pages to keep them in and I wish there was a pocket/folder.

Sometimes it is a little tricky to get the paper out without tearing it so use care.  The paper is about as thick as a thinner cardstock. Some markers show through like Copics and Sharpies.

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Binding issues", "review_body": "Fairly basic tracing paper.  The pages themselves perform well for what they are but I have an issue that detracts from a quality paper.  My issue is with the binding.  It is glued at the top in a sort of flip top style but there are enough pages that when you lift the cover the entire binding starts to peel apart.  I imagine this was done to make the pages easy to remove since a typical perforation wouldn't work with such a thin paper but I am concerned the entire pad will fall apart.  My pages are also wrinkled from the way the binding is.  This can be frustrating but tracing paper is a transitional paper and not one to display your finished art.  If you don't care about the pad staying together and are undeterred by wrinkled pages this paper is good quality and performs well with a decent variety of medium."},

However, a major selling point was the answer to some of the questions about the product. One says the the pens and refills are numbered for easy matching, but there are no such numbers on mine. Also, the product description (at the time) said there were \"magic\" pens and \"dye colors\" I have no idea what that means but on the package it lists all the kind of pens there are and it does not list these. The description has been updated since my purchase (4 days ago).  Due to these issues I reduced my rating to 4stars. I do love these pens though. Most of them are very smooth writing. The only ones that are scratchy are the ones that are scratchy no matter what brand you buy (pastels)."},

Seems like a really great bargain!  Im not experienced using gel pens, but something i found was i painted the flowers in the pic first and then colored in the yellow dress and some of the ink pulled from the flowers to the yellow.  Also notices that jf you need to change a color, depending on the lightness of the color, it is no problem with the gel pen!  I hope it came out in pix but used the gel pens for flowers in yellow dress and the metallic in the silver dress.  My new favorites!  So fun!~  Not sure if there is a drying time for this ink and there are no tips for use.  Ill figure it out, but i plan on buying this pack as a gift for my nieces!  Great set.

I also purchased this set along with Cedar Marker 200 gel pen set. They both work pretty much the same some flow better than others while also there are a few problematic pens. A few of the pens have such a fine point that I see no other use for them other than writing and even then compared to my own pens they are still much finer. The number one problem with these gel pens like other reviewers have mentioned as well are the numbering. The pen's gel numbers are written but on the ink fill outer casing (not the pen itself) and the lettering is extremely small and hardly visible and several of the pens did not have the number. I actually had to use a flashlight to see what was written. If you can work around the numbering all in all it's a good set of gel pens with a wide selection of colors and types. One other thing to mention all the gel pens does work however one of them I had to warm it up and keep scratching the surface of the paper but it works better now and has a nice ink flow. The swirl pens doesn't swirl at first usage I believe you need to keep using it for the other colors to show through. This is a good set but I don't believe I will be repurchasing it in the future."},

It is too common for pens (and pencils really) for the ink to smudge on my hand and across the page trying to write. So far I haven't gotten a single smudge on my hand.

Because I was trying to please her with a gift, and not myself and my feminist sensibilities, lol, and I thought she'd get more use out of the templates - because the templates are different in the pink and blue versions.

I did not give these five stars because the coverage of the pastels was a little spotty. You can see little white spots of paper where the pastel did not cover fully. There were so many that is was difficult to smooth them all out.

{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "Work like waxy crayons", "review_body": "I was looking for a pastel that would blend well and not have a lot of chalky residue to deal with. Well, there's no chalky dust, The sticks behave like waxy crayons and are impossible to blend. If you press hard wax builds up and it's impossible to blend at all. I'm extremely disappointed in this product after all the great reviews I read I'm wondering how children can get the results that are advertised. I guess you get what you pay for. I did see a video about how the oil pastels have a tendency to build a hard outer shell and need to be wiped off from time to time. I tried the suggestion and nothing changed. If you use a blending stub it removes the bright color and you end up with a dull flat color as you can see in the example I've included. I can only assume from the other reviews that I must have a very old set of these pastels that have turned to wax."},

While pastels, in general, are messy, these washed off my hands with regular soap and water and minimal effort. This set is currently listed at $29 which seems comparable in price to other media such as watercolor markers or pencils, so seems like a reasonable value to me, however, I am honestly not familiar with the going rate for oil pastels and base my perceived value on media I purchase regularly. I enjoyed using these and make a fun addition to my collection."},

When I got these I was excited because she began to love coloring. She used these so much that I had to buy another set shortly. Now that she is older these are still her favorite to color with although she uses crayons now without any complaints. These so have a thicker application that crayons and can smudge so you do have to be a little more careful with where you place the oil pastel but these are great. I even like to use them. Love the colors offered as well. I'd get these again in a heartbeat."},

It holds up very well to paints and pencils and pens. There IS some bleed through with certain kinds of markers, but that's honestly to be expected with any kind of paper expect super thick types. So basically what I do is tear out one sheet to place behind the current one being used, to make sure there is no bleed through or anything.

This paper stands up well to charcoal, colored pencil, pastels, markers, etc. You can also use watercolors as long as you don\u2019t completely saturate the page, otherwise the paper will warp.

I love that they came with refills so I don't have to buy a whole new set when one color runs out. There is a couple of cons though: The case is super nice, but it is not user friendly. Trying to maneuver that thing to get to the color you want is quite a pain in the you-know-what. I'm a little OCD, and I noticed this before I bought them, but they are not in color order and that is about to drive me crazy, but I plan to go through and organize them. I love that it comes with the list that tells you how much of each of them, but it is pretty hard to decipher what is what, it would be nice if they were labeled as such instead of just on the package. Overall I would definitely give these pens 4.5 stars out of 5 for the minor flaws I found. I bought a pack of 48 gel pens (thats not even half of what comes in this for way more than half the price of these!) from somewhere else for $15.00 and only about half of them worked if even that.

Finally, the price is unbelievable for this full set of 10 excellent pens, and I would recommend them with one word of caution:  bleeding.  With even the most normal writing pressure, the pens bleed through average-weight paper.  In my experience, writing on standard tablets, binder paper, etc. leaves very legible shadows on the reverse side of the paper.

Finally, I changed sharpeners, four times. No. So these are only worth a college dorm set at best. I even went a long way into using them, getting mad, getting frustrated.

Highly pigmented, strong colors, the perfect set for field work and at home. Can be used on several different types of surfaces, like pastel paper, sketchbook paper,( I prefer sketchbook paper), Acrylic paper, Canvas Board. They can be a little messy on your hands, but it comes off easily with a paper towel or just wash your hands with soap and water. One way to insure that the oil pastels don't move around too much in the box is to lay a sheet of paper towel on top of the pastels underneath the clear sheet that holds them in place. I also recommend putting a large rubber band around the box to insure the tray doesn't slide out. I have also tried putting the smaller sets in plastic bags to keep water off them when traveling."},

The pens look exactly like their picture, light to hold and nice color variety."},

I love the 7x10 size of this sketchbook; for me, it's plenty of size to work in and write in without being cramped but also without feeling like I'm trying to fill all this extra space. It's not too bulky and the paper, binding, and cover have held up very well over the months I've been carrying it with me all over.  Paper quality is nice. Not too smooth or rough, great for dry media. I haven't tried it with much wet media so I'm not sure how it holds up with that. I agree with other reviewers that have said it is somewhat hard to get a clean tear from the perforation, but I don't remove pages from my sketchbooks much so that didn't bother me."},

The light pad is quite simple to use. The problem we ran into was the drawings to trace are all way too complex for a 5 yo. I went to the website but Crayola's entire selection had very little that would be easy for a little one to trace. I thought to get other coloring books but my daughter didn't want to tear the pages out. If you get simple drawings for them to trace, it would probably work very well, but me not knowing that, my daughter got upset and frustrated with what came in the box. I'd like to perserve though because I think that they probably can learn how to draw if they stick with it. Also, they could have easily included a storage compartment on the back. Without that, I fear it will become another toy with a bazillion pieces that get lost. To their credit you can go for free onto the Crayola website and re-print the tracing sheets and you can use plain white paper to draw on.  You don't need special tracing paper. Finally, it is a bit hard to see the light when the room is sunny.  In the instructions they recommend you save the box it came in to provide shade, but that is obviously lame. That cardboard box will fall apart in short order.  It is not really a big problem as it works fine with room lighting."},

The paper is very high quality, thick enough to use with copic type markers (alcohol markers), pencils, gel pens, watercolor pencils and paint. Both of my artistic children prefer sketch books that are not spiral bound, but more of a tablet type of book, however this Canson sketch book has a fine perforation near the spiral binding so the sketches/paintings can be removed from the sketch book with a beautiful clean edge. I was so impressed by the quality of this book I brought it to share with a professional artist friend of mine, she was also impressed. This is a great purchase for ages 0 to 110, from budding artist to professional. The price is quite inexpensive for the quality and quantity of pages.

I actually purchased this paper so that I could bind it into a smaller, more portable sketchbook and figured that the extra paper in the larger size would be great to fully flesh out more detailed ideas.  Because the paper is so unexpectedly thick (I'd say about as thick as four sheets of standard printer paper) it was difficult to bend and cut, but it certainly all worked out in the end."},

Smoother paper than the Darice, and much smoother (and significantly heavier, which is not an issue for me one way or the other), and cheaper than the Strathmore. I would definitely buy it again if it came in a 9\"x12\" size, and will buy it again anyway, even in the 7\"x10\", for a portable, or drawing-on-my-lap pad. The pages are perforated, and remove very easily and cleanly, but not unless (and until) you want them to."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Perfect", "review_body": "I have found that the Canson Multi/Mixed Media series notebooks are the best for Zentangle. In most of my sketchbooks I've used in the past, the ink from the pens bleed through the paper onto the next page so I do a drawing on every other page, unless I use a pencil. In this Canson  notebook, the Sharpies bleed through to the other side but not on to the next page. The paper in these books is very good quality. I love the size of the 7 x 10 book. It's perfect for me. The paper is smooth and soft and takes the ink so well. This is my favorite sketchbook. I've tried quite a few and this one is perfect for drawing and using other mediums."},

I'm roughly 75% through the book and this is definetly the best sketchbook I have found for art journaling.  The paper is a good weight and I haven't had any issues with tearing or bleeding through.  I use a variety of materials and do a lot of layer which tends to be heavy and hard on paper.  Highly watered down paint, scrubbing with baby wipes, tape, glue, adding paper etc it all holds up without any issue.  The covers of the book are heavy paperboard and have held up very well.  I would defintly purchase this book again."},

HOWEVER...  I know something MOST have changed in the production of these sketchbooks because the perforated edges SUCK! it has become more a folder than a sketchbook because every page a draw on literally just falls out eventually!

She loves to draw but her fine motor skills were still pretty shaky, this seemed like a fun way to help improve those! There was a little frustration at first because the pictures they give you to trace are definitely aimed older but she still loved it and persevered, as I'd hoped she would. Now at 6 she uses this constantly. I think it was definitely helpful in improving her ability to draw more precise lines. The only thing I wish is that they gave a link to down load more pictures and scenes to trace. Now my 4 year old son is wanting one too. I'm hesitant because he definitely does not have the ability to trace these types of scenes yet and it will lead to frustration and anger. So more variety of things to trace would be helpful to make this more useful to a larger range of ages. You could print up any kind of line drawing to trace, but finding them can be work."},

It works great. The room doesn't have to be dark to see the image to trace. It lights up perfectly. And I love the different options of tracing packs you can print online.

This is hands down the worst watercolor paper I have ever used and is so frustrating to work with. It literally RESISTS water in random places on the paper, which makes it good for painting..... ice cream. I can't think of anything else that would look decent with choppy edges. If you're looking to make a nice clean line, forget it. It's not even good for doing quick preparatory paintings to eventually do on better paper because it won't mimic anything about how the painting will flow on good paper. Over large areas of color, paint will pool in some areas, and then absorb in others, leading to random \"cauliflowers\" everywhere. Also forget trying to blend colors."},

Taking the time and inconvenience to pre-stretch helps about half the time. The problem is that the paper is wood pulp based, which wreaks havoc with how the paint reacts to the paper. If you must use this paper, paint as dry as possible and use one layer. Adding other layers will start the buckling, causing peaks and valleys in the paper, which starts the paint to pool in the valleys. Your paints lose their vibrancy with this paper also. Switch to 100% Cotton papers instead. The difference is night and day."},

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "With some staining colors like pthalo blue", "review_body": "I am new to watercolor and read that 140lb  is the go to weight for painting, saw this inexpensively priced watercolor paper and bought it. For starters, you get what you pay for.  This is not Arches or Fabriano 100% cotton paper.  When doing wet on wet techniques, and layering, the paper starts to disintegrate.  The paper also tends to buckle.  With some staining colors like pthalo blue; they are very hard to lift off the paper- overworking  and disintegration becomes an issue with that as well.  I am using my 12 half pan Winsor Newton cotman brand paints and most of them are not too pigmented so lifting some of the colors is possible (sometimes).  The two pros this paper has is it's price, good for practicing, but you just have to be careful with scrubbing and over working the paper and that the paper is vivid white, it has no tint, this is probably due to some processing but I'm not complaining.  I am half way through the book and have a feel for getting around some it's shortcomings."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Not your go to paper for frameable art works but it has its uses", "review_body": "I bought several of these when Michaels had a BOGO sale and was excited about my haul.  Unfortunately I was disappointed in the quality of the paper.  It does not handle wet on wet work very well nor repeated applications of layers of wash.  The paper pills when lifting color by gently scrubbing or lifting with damp brush if you must repeat after first attempt.  In addition, the watercolor really absorbs into the page dulling the vibrancy of transparent colors which is my primary concern using this paper.  However, it does have good qualities as well, for the price I don\u2019t have any inhibitions about experimenting, I often use it to try out new mixed media supplies, I. Carry around smaller pads for impromptu doodling, urban sketching, or art journaling.  Also good for working out monochromatic value scales of a painting or thumbnail sketches during composition. So, all in all, I can\u2019t say it was a waste of money, in fact it\u2019s probably saved me hundreds by not wasting so much of my better paper with random aimless doodling, calligraphy practice and so fourth....maybe I should give it 4 stars."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Don't paint your \"masterpieces\" on this, lol.", "review_body": "I can get this paper at Wal-Mart now for about 6 bucks(They just started carrying it where I'm at in TX). I'm not a huge fan of this paper and only gave it 3 stars, because it's affordable and decent to use for practice, but I don't recommend trying to do some serious painting on this paper. This paper does *not* handle multiple or even single washes well; the sizing comes off easily and I find that my colors look incredibly dull. I've had alot of problems with \"puddles\" forming on my paintings due to the sheer warping of this paper(Even when I tape down or try to stretch the paper prior to painting). Save this paper for practice/scrap and don't soak this paper. Just my opinion. I've bought this maybe 3 times now and I'm fairly confident it's not the batch."},

I think that with any watercolor paper of this weight, a lot depends on how you use your medium. I don't tend to scrub my brush on the paper, I have a lighter touch spreading my colors so perhaps that is why I am not having the problems a few others have had with pilling. For me the paper is a nice weight, has a good hand feel, not as rough as some other brands of cold press. It stretches well and remains flat for me after. The great part is that lesser priced papers like this are great for practicing new techniques and also for beginners. Always when changing papers do a practice run with a sheet of the paper to determine how your medium works with that particular paper. Some brands of paper resist more than others so know your particular paper before beginning."},

I don't know if there's two factories for it or what, it seems the reviews on it are pretty sharply divided. All I can say is the paper I have barely gets wet before it starts pilling, the painting I tried to do is not even finished and the paper is trying to roll itself up at the edges. For the price I thought I would give it a shot but unless you are giving this paper to a small child to practice on and you don't really care how the final result looks I would not say this paper is worth it."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Not for Traditional Watercolor, but Great for This Technique", "review_body": "I have been using the back side of this paper for watercolor combined with black Sharpie.  I use the back side of the paper because it is smoother for the Sharpie to glide across, and my pen stays sharp longer.  The black ink makes the watercolors look really bright and intense.  I love the effect.  I CANNOT do tons of watercolor techniques on this paper, and especially not the back, but it works really well for this particular technique.  Because this paper is inexpensive I can make art nearly every day without feeling like I am spending tons of money."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "Don't bother with it.", "review_body": "Unfortunately, I still have a pad and a half of this paper. I'm fairly new to watercoloring and I thought it was me. Then, I thought it was my new brushes. If you try to do wet on wet or any blending, even a light wash, this gel-like stuff develops on the paper. The more you try to brush it off, the more it sort of foams up. I had wondered if maybe there was some soap in my new brushes or something, but it happens with all my brushes. I'm thinking maybe it's cheap sizing? Also, there are random spots that repel the water/paint and there's barely any texture. I'm sad because it seemed like it was a good deal. Nope."},

The paper is FANTASTIC and it's SO GOOD to use watercolors on it. It's super resistant, doesn't bleed out and gives you enough chances for mistakes. I don't hesitate to buy this brand again and again because it's great, but it would be PERFECT if the pages could stay intact to one another. I 100% GUARANTEE it'll tear apart as you continuously use it.. So make sure you have a place to store the papers you use"},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "I've bought this paper several times because I liked the smooth texture", "review_body": "I've bought this paper several times because I liked the smooth texture, but this paper does not hold well onto watercolors. The paint fades and does not hold the vibrant colors that should come with using watercolor, and it dries too quickly which leaves the paint looking blotchy. This also makes it incredibly difficult to make washes with color because it dries too quickly. It's incredibly finicky, and I've been using watercolor for years now but this paper has made painting incredibly difficult for me. If you're just beginning painting this product will probably only make you feel frustrated. I would not buy this paper unless you're looking for something cheap to experiment with."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I disagree with the negative reviews of this product", "review_body": "I have had excellent experience with this paper.  I don't do translucent watercolor washes, but opaque technique, and I have not had a problem with the paper breaking down. It does tend to buckle on the ends, but that's not a big issue to me.  I'm a newbie to watercolors, and I find this suits my needs perfectly. I paint a lot, so I go through a fair amount of paper in a short time, and this is economical, but thick (in my opinion) good quality paper.  I say give it a try and if it doesn't work, try another brand."},

It is far superior to the Strathmore Watercolor Papers (other than the blocks) for pieces where you plan to use an \"under sketch\" because its texture makes it easy to sketch lightly. (By contrast, the Strathmore, in all series that I have used, has a much rougher texture that can be pleasing when experimenting with different brush techniques, but which makes the paper extremely difficult to sketch on.)"},

However, after just one wash, this paper has had it; two washes and it starts coming off in layers. This is the most horrible watercolor paper I've ever used.

I had a while without using oil pastels, but I've been lucky enough to hold a good one! lol Which means I know the difference between a good & a bad one! This product is in between or a little lower. I found that you need to layer them in order to get a smooth blend. Without layering, this product is just a grade or 2 higher than a crayola. With that said, I used up all the white trying to layer & had to purchase a box of 12 whites only! Since seeing how quick my whites were going, I decided to try another way to save some money, so I tried Vaseline with the pastels, just to see how they would blend! It ended up being a bit messy, but I was able to smooth it out with my finger, something that would be close to impossible with the oil pastel alone!"},

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Not impressed", "review_body": "First, my specific need was the variety of sizes, mainly the detail brushes. I paint for hours at a time on a daily basis and for the most part I paint what most would consider excruciatingly small areas. This is my opinion based on my needs. Great price. However I'm not impressed with these at all. I have better brushes that came with paint by numbers that I saved and still use. The bristles are uneven making them impractical for precise or flexible line work. Stray bristles drag and spring out of place. Ultimately I trimmed them with nail scissors. Even the larger flat brushes are so thin painting a large area looks like it would be a pain. These are not designed for heavy use or frequent cleaning and won't last long. The bristles will fray quickly. Overall I'm disappointed, but I didn't spend that much on them so no huge loss and you can't ever really have too many paint brushes. I personally feel these are good for kid's projects or a classroom or something to get you by. Also good for what I like to call \"loaners\". These are decent, and will definitely get the job done, however for my specific needs these weren't a great purchase."},

I feel that the metal that holds the brush heads in place could have been clamped more securely and evenly, but that may just be my picky side piping in. The package was squished and crinkled in shipping and as a result a few of the brush heads were a bit misshapen, but a good use and wash fixes the problem, so not too worried there. The hairs on the brushes themselves were pretty standard and had a good feel to them but as with any lower priced set, are nothing to rave about. For the money, this was a worthwhile purchase, but if you are looking for top shelf quality, look elsewhere. These are basically the poster child for mediocrity in the paint brush world. They will get the job done, they might even last for a reasonable amount of time, but they are by no means what I would deem 5 star brushes. If I was rating on price to value alone, they would get 5 stars but I have to include in my thoughts all the other brushes out there that are possibly higher quality and similar cost. If you are just beginning, or are doing some sort of art that takes a toll on brushes, i.e. letting children use them, these are great.

I had to use a magnifying glass to find the 'AP' label on the reverse side of the box.  I did not feel comfortable giving this set of oil pastels to a young child, so I donated it to my local church thrift shop.  Therefore, I cannot attest to the quality of the pastels.

While I definitely found chalk pastels far easier to work with overall (the both blend easier and are easier to keep separate when putting one color over another), I loved the color that these produced. I even placed in an art show with my project. Now, I haven't been steadily practicing over the years so I'd say that what I made in high school was my best work to date, but now that I'm out of college and stable again I've been trying to practice with them every day because oil pastels are so vibrant. And much easier to work with than paint (less messy - though don't take that for not messy at all because oil pastels have their own kind of mess, it's just not as big as painting messes - and really all you need is your pastels and some paper as opposed to brushes and pallets and water and so on)."},

They are fun without going broke buying them. I like using them on Mi-Teintes paper. You need to apply the oil pastels in layers for a good look, usually layers of 2 or 3 colors. If you just put one layer it's going to look scratchy with the paper showing through. Look on youtube for techniques. I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because some of the colors aren't very opaque on dark paper, and this is a student grade oil pastel. I like using oil pastels because it's a simple, clean way to get to create colored art without making a mess like acrylic or oil paint. Plus it's challenging to make a satisfactory artwork with oil pastels. I like that challenge. I just get these out sometimes and mess with them for fun. But lately I'm starting to get a little more into oil pastels and I'm thinking about making complete oil pastel paintings. I wouldn't get a set of any oil pastels or pencils that has less than about 50 colors, because when you buy a set of about 24 colors or less, you just don't have enough colors to do what you want."},

In my painting class we used Baby Oil and a pint brush to help blend them, which I highly recommend as it improves their performance a tenfold. finally, if you order these, which if you want cheap pastels I highly recommend these, but get the 36 or 50 color set. we used the 16 set at school, and there wasn't a true purple. there was a slightly purple indigo and a light pink, but really no purple. you can mix a purple but it takes alot of time and baby oil, plus it eats your pastels. that's why I gave it a 3 instead of a 4."},

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Worked well enough.", "review_body": "These worked great for art class. I'm a teacher and I have several grades (K-8) and these are a decent quality. I did NOT like how quickly they got used up and how easily they broke as the students used them. They blend well, but they become very messy. Extra clean up time had to be given so some (if not most) students could wash their hands. For the price, they were worth it and have managed to last long enough."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "High Quality and Perfect Set of Pastels", "review_body": "Who doesn't want a great set of pastels? Pentel Arts Oil Pastels are definitely a classic must have for any young artist. I bought this set for my niece and was very tempted to keep the set for myself. The range of the 50 colors were very, very nice, and made me reminisce over childhood memories. It's a wonderful gift to give, or if you're looking to get started on pastels, work with this set. They're delightful!"},

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Not Good With Water", "review_body": "I'm only going to give 4 stars because unlike what it says on the box these do not work with water.However they do work with vegetable oil,baby oil and my favorite linseed oil and a q tip.This review is for those artists who would like to use them in their journal a professional artist wouldn't buy them.I use sennelier and caran de ache for my professional work.If you want to use these in your journal I suggest heavy paper at least 140lb hot or cold press,q tips and one of the oils above you can also gesso your page if the paper is thin or needs more tooth.These do not blend with a stump or tortillo or a water or oil brush.You can scrape it with a pallete knife with fairly good results and the colors do blend together well once you apply the oil."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Fun and Cheap Color", "review_body": "I've actually only used these a couple times, but when I have used them they're fun.  A nice range of vivid, blendable colors.  Obviously the blunt ends aren't going to be great for fine details, but you can get some fun textured effects by pushing hard with some sweeping strokes.  You blow through them really fast that way, but at six bucks a set why not?  (Try not to overdo it, though; they're soft, break easy.  And maybe check at local stores to avoid shipping.  = ) )  These are also an affordable alternative for artists who like colored pencils but can't afford the steep prices.  All around if you want to relax with some fun color, this is a great way to go."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great for sketching!", "review_body": "Wonderful oil pastels! I am a die-hard acrylic painter but wanted to try something different for a bit and since I've always enjoyed sketching, I bought this set.

Primary among my peeves are fingerprints left by the manufacturers that only show up when I am 75% finished with a drawing. Nevertheless, I have been using Strathmore 400 for some time now and find it an excellent support for my work. You can never go too far wrong with Strathmore.

I wouldn't recommend it if your someone who just sketches now and then, and doesn't keep your work because it is probably a little too pricey to just be doodling on and tossing.

Only issue with the pens is that the packaging is not identical to the brand shown in picture. Rather than a \"MyLifeUnit\" pair of pens, I got a \"Sipa\" brand of pens with Chinese writing across. That being said I can't complain as the pens are inexpensive and are only desired for a specific purpose of note writing.

That being said I still rated it a 5 out 5 because although I had this problem fairly quickly after receiving the product this hasn't ultimately effect the writing and I have had similar problems with other products of the same type. Also none of the other pens have had this problem only the black pen and it is probably because I tend to write heavily when I am writing quickly and want to get an idea onto the paper.

I am afraid to write hard or lend them out lol just incase they write hard (because of the reviews) but I do like all the colors and how they write, so far no splitting. I have to admit I do love how slender they are they feel real great in my hands but my son who has bigger hands think they are to thin. I do hear a \"scratching\" sound sometimes when writing with them but hey for the price they will do. I would recommend them and some of my friends even liked them so all in all a good purchase."},
