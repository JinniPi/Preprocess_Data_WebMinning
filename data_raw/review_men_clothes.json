It's great as I stay visible when working out outside but it is quite the statement under the harsh fluorescents in my gym. Anyway, it's a great lightweight shirt that doesn't hold in smell that is common to other quick-drying shirts. I got an XL and it fits true to size. My only complaint is that the seams around the arms fall a little weird and it almost feels like the sleeves are just a smidge too short. For instance, when I lift a barbell over my head, the whole shirt rides up more than usual. Not a detrimental flaw, just something to keep in mind."},

I am always worried about buying items such as this here, for fear that I might be getting a knock-off product. I have been lucky with the few items I had bought from Amazon so far, so I took a chance and purchased 4 of these UA tech tees when they had a 25% off sale. Unfortunately, this time I was not so lucky, and I really feel like these aren't official UA shirts. The material is extremely thin, with less sheen, and a tiny bit less stretch/give and/or natural movement than other tees of this type I've purchased in the past. The UA logo is flat white, not grey/silver/reflective, and it just looks cheap/fake. The overall appearance of the shirt suffers far more than the money I saved. I won't buy these on Amazon in the future, nor would I recommend others purchase them here."},

In fact I love them so much, I order 2 more in different colors. If I had to nitpick (and it's the nature of the fabric, not Under Armour or this particular shirt), it's the static cling issues. Obviously if I'm wearing the shirt to exercise or work in the yard, I sweat enough that static cling doesn't pose a problem.  But if I'm just lounging around the house (not sweating), this fabric does have a tendency to develop cling (and generate static shocks).  But again, I have similar issues with other brands/makers...not just UA."},

Target had the C9 Champion Tech t shirt for only 10 dollars that was more lightweight than this one. Old Navy had a lightweight and breathable shirt that was better than the Under Armour too. Kohls had the best shirt that was lightweight, breathable, well made and it wicked my sweat away too. The C9 champion Duo Dry Tech Tee shirt, the Old Navy Active Go Dry shirt and the Tek Gear Drytek shirt from kohls were all cheaper and better than this Under Armour shirt."},

Hopefully they will shrink just a bit in length and hold up through wearing and washing. If so it's great value for $20. Update: after two wearings and washings, these pants have held up fine, shrunk up just a bit 1/4 to 1/2 inch maybe in legs and held wrinkle free crease. I bought black, khaki, and navy, great casual/office pants. I'm a teacher so perfectly fine for that setting.  Cotton is also fairly lightweight and breathable."},

After being washed and thrown in the dryer, they come out and look nice and seems like they didn't shrink much or at all. They might be ready to wear right out of the dryer, maybe touch them up a little with an iron. As far as fit, I am 6 ft. 2 in. or so and around 220 lbs. I bought the 38 waist and 34 length. The 34 length seems a little longer than other 34 length pants I own. The fit is definitely not a slim fit, pretty much straight and standard fit which I like. The material is not too bad, definitely not as nice as my $79 Eddie Bauer pants, but I'm sure I'll wear these once or twice a week for a couple of years and get my money's worth for sure. If you are looking for decent quality and an inexpensive option for work khakis, these are the ones."},

I have reached an age where I no longer seem to have to buy clothes very often, so it has been a while since I bought one of these. I swear the Hanes ones are always better fitting than the competition. They make a nice standard hoodie at a great price. It has been a few years since I bought one of these and Hanes has changed them a bit. The gray was lighter than my old one and then inner lining is different. The lining is soft, nice to touch, and a bit linty. I do not recall my old one being as soft and linty, but I could be wrong. It definitely needs a wash and dry cycle to get the initial lintiness off. That is the only reason I would not give it 5 stars. I usually just wear Hanes black tees underneath these and lint is noticeable. I suspect that will eventually go away, but still I suspect Hanes could have produced it with less lint and simply choose not too. Still I like the hoodie and you should buy it."},

Of course, the sleeves are too long since it's a men's jacket & I'm a short female. 5'2\" and 175-ish. Everything fits good except the sleeves. I'm going to wash it & hope it shrinks a little. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase & at $14 it was a great bargain. I will order another color in the MEDIUM & see if that fits better. Still I love it."},

Also, the material is very thin. After reading other negative reviews, I can see that this material won't last very long, as I suspected. I'm going to go to a Levis outlet store and see if all of their quality is this bad. If they are not knock-offs, they must be factory seconds.

As much as I didn't want to go along with the 1 star bandwagon, I feel it is highly necessary. Levi's are not true to fit and are made with extremely low craftsmanship.

We're wondering if they are going to hold up, since other reviewers also noted that the jeans are thinner than previous editions. We bought these on Amazon after looking at the same product in the local department store which had them for $10 more. Products seem identical in every way, fabric thinner on both versions.

I checked the Hanes website, and it says all are 100% cotton except the Heather which is 75% ... so I ordered the green body with heather sleeves, and the tag says pretty close to what the website says ... the body is 100% cotton, while the sleeves are 60/40.

These are a knock-off product!", "review_body": "I have a long history with this cut of Levi's, and this particular pair, made in Cambodia, are just a bit slimmer than the last pair that came from Mexico.  These are cheaply made pants without the characteristic orange stitching, sold under the Levi name and made out of lightweight denim.  The fabric is obviously thinner and woven less densely than the Levi's I grew up with and have come to expect, and I fear that they will wear out quickly.  I am glad that a worker in Cambodia has a job making clothing.  That seems reasonable to me.  I just wish that the \"used-to-be\" American company Levi Strauss would hold to their old standards, and when they contract out to the global market insist on fabrics that meet American standards.  At the very least, this product should be described as \"levi's\" with a lower case \"L\" and being of lightweight, and not middleweight, material!"},

For the next 6 months, I wore that pair and a second pair of Levi's in a slightly different style that I bought in a store.

The rest... god the rest... the rest are just pure trash. A pair from Mexico that claim to be size 38 but fit like size 34's with super tight thighs and bell bottom like ends. A pair from Egypt that have an almost fake feel to the denim and an over sized waist with very tight calve sections. A pair from Vietnam that just don't fit at all due to a really weird 'poof' feel to the back side. I'm so fed up with this. What happened to this company? What happened to Levis making denim jeans for the everyday man and woman? Is your manufacturing process so scattered that you can't even pull together the same materials?? Or roughly the same measurements? I mean come on, how does a size 44 equal a size 38 but a size 38 equals a size 42?

Buying pants off the internet can be tricky for fit. And so it goes. I recently purchased a pair of 559 denims from a brick and mortar store in the same size as I ordered here. They fit great. Not too loose, not too tight and a comfortable relaxed straight leg construction. I wanted a comfy summer khaki colored jean to offset the blue jeans and cargo shorts, so I thought I'd knock it out of the park with these. For reference, if these are denim, they are a particularly light weight/thin denim (which is fine, they are meant for summer wear so lighter isnt bad imo), yet not quite the sort of classic chinos twill pant light weight. Most notably however, they run tighter than the jeans i bought 20 days ago in the store. Maybe they are supposed to be more form fitting, but if the site model is an indicator these are too tight (not even room for speculation). I've sent them back anticipating ordering a waist size larger. Hope this helps."},

These are definitely \"relaxed fit\", very casual, so be sure that's what you want. I don't want to focus too much on the specifics of the style, because I think that depends mostly on trying on the jeans and checking out yourself in a mirror. So, I'm going to write about what I find helpful - does the wash of the jeans look like the picture? and what does the fabric feel like? (because if you've looked at Levi's before you know the denim ranges from pretty thin to very chunky). So, the wash in the picture is not exactly representative of what I received - the two pairs I got aren't as dark as the dark areas in the picture and the light areas aren't as light. So, overall, a little less contrast and a little lighter blue than the picture. They come off a little more Dad-ish than I had hoped, but not overly so (plus, I'm a Dad, so I guess the shoe fits). The denim is definitely one of the thinner variations I've seen on the 559. Personally, I prefer the thinner denim for the added flexibility/comfort, but, in my experience at least, the thinner denim wears out a bit quicker.  Overall, I think this is a nice wash, but I would have preferred something with slightly more contrast and the fabric suits my preference."},

The neck tie thing still looks like new, and the sleeves have been stretched from being pushed up my arms, but that's normal wear and tear. While it's light enough to wear in summer, I wear it as an additional layer under my winter coat and love it! I even bought a second one, as this was initially for a Red Hood cosplay for Batman comics, and I ended up loving it a little too much. Constantly. I wore it to bed because I was chilly okay. Fully love this item, going to probably buy it for a long time. I bought a \"large\", knowing it would be bigger on me, and that's what Hoodies are made for right? Medium would be pushed against me and not tight but snug. Large means I can pull my arms and legs in comfortably if I'm really chilly and pretend it's more of a boyfriend shirt than something for myself, and we all know it's extra comfy to snuggle down in something a size too big (but not comedically big) for you.

From Levies direct we purchased 10 pairs of 560 in which the material was completely different than pictured and replacements were the same.  We also tried some 550 black and the same was true with big differences in the sizing.  The sales people were very nice but had no idea of what they were shipping.  If someone showed me these jeans without tags I would think they were knock offs because of the poor quality and off sizing!  I think this is why there is so much difference in what buyers are reporting back.  You can not be sure what you are going to receive and neither does the sales dept. of Levies.com.  At least with Amazon or Zappos if you should receive a bad pair of Levies returns are easy.  With Levies.com. this was not the case for us.  In Levies the good are good and the bad are completely unacceptable. The men's Levis 550 medium stone washed jeans we have recently received from Amazon and Zappos have been well constructed with the good old heavy denim, which we expect and demand from Levi's, and the good correct fit which is not too much to ask for from their loyal old customers.  Otherwise Levi's will lose us! Some people may think Levis should pay more attention to their quality control and less attention to their political advertising concerning social engineering."},

In addition to that, the second time I wore them the front button fell off without me even noticing, something I have never experience with Levi's jeans. I even ended up cutting my finger on the jagged metal stud when I reached down to unbutton. I am not overweight and have purchased a variety of \"less loose\" fitting jeans without this issue. After doing a little research I have determined that these ARE NOT REAL LEVI'S and are actually a knock-off with poor fit and workmanship. I know for sure because the little red tab on the back pocket doesn't even say \"LEVI'S\" on it. just a trademark symbol with no letters or anything else.

I usually associate Levi's brand with good quality jeans; it's certainly a famous brand. And at the price of 50 bucks a pair, I was hoping to get my money's worth. That is not really even any savings over the in-store prices, but I thought it would be more convenient than going to the store and searching through the piles for a right size. But what I received must be classified as a factory 2nd or 3rd that was likely rejected by the brick and mortar stores. The pockets and pant legs are slightly frayed, and these are not supposed to be one of those \"distressed\" style jeans. Not only that, but the zipper was somehow bent at a 90 degree angle. If these were cheap then maybe I could write off those defects as getting what you pay for. But these are top dollar jeans from a top brand, so it's not acceptable."},

Compared to the store bought ones (which were from Bangladesh I believe), these were from Mexico. They fit a little more snug in the waist (almost too much so) and the denim is thinner / lighter weight. After a long day of wear comparing both, these become a bit baggy in the butt versus the others bought retail. I bought these on Amazon because my local Belk ran out of my size. Next time I will prob go to the Belk website and just order from there and pay the shipping, which sucks as I am an Amazon Prime member and like the 2-day shipping included in the items I buy.  All in all these jeans suffice and will work I guess, but for the same retail price at Belk I will go back there in the future. Hope this helps someone make a decision and I despise the fact there are too many variables in a specific line of Jeans that I feel should be uniform in quality and consistency no matter where purchased- especially with a big name brand."},

So if you happen to be using any sort of machinery, tools, etc... and one of the strings gets caught... you could be in for some serious trouble. Think: home mixer, drill press, saw, car engine, pretty much anything with rotating parts to grab the string as you look and pull you in.

So I got out the tape measure and it seems that the old ones, which were suppose to be 38, were actually 40\" and the new ones which are suppose to be 40 are only 39\". You'd think with a product that is sized in 2\" increments the margin of error would be less then +/- 2\". I returned them for some 42s we'll see how those fit in a couple days."},

So after about 8, perhaps 10, wearings, where I sit at a desk, the  if worn through. I've used Levi's for 40 years or more. Eventually pants wear out. Usually at seams around the pockets. I've never seen anything like this. I wonder if it wasn't overly aggressive stonewashing, because there are a number of areas on the jeans that are much lighter than other areas. It is those areas that seem to be breaking down much, much faster than would be expected. The same day I bought this pair, I also bought a pair of 36x34's and I ended up returning those after just over a month when the stitching starting coming off. That was hard as it was a few days beyond the return date. This is 2+ months, so I don't figure that I'll even try, but buyer beware."},

However, these pants are not your old school black denim Levis jeans...they fit perfect but they are \"stretchy\" and \"flex\" and seem to be made more for comfort than durability.  Sad to say, but only wrangler seems to still make the affordable denim black and of course if you got the money you can buy higher end (quality) jeans that truly have some heft to them.

Just received them and they fit exactly like the other pair. It's possible Levi's has sorted the sizing inconsistencies that over reviewers report, or I just have been lucky, or maybe it's only with certain colors. Build quality seems to be much better than some other Levi's I've had in the past that have worn out way too fast and seem super thin and cheap.

However, I can't deny how comfortable they are. I expect these jeans to last a while, as have most Levi's jeans I've owned.

The jeans from the department store were much thicker and heavier (so they'll last much longer) than Amazon's, and are much more durable. I bought six pairs from Amazon and am disappointed in the inferior quality. I feel like I got ripped off.  Levi's should not sell the same model but with different quality to different retailers. That is deceptive to consumers. Alternately, Amazon and Levi's should publish the material weight so consumers know what they're buying. I will not buy Levi's again from Amazon."},

Where I used to be able to get roughly 100 washes/dry's, I can now only seem to manage 60-75 before a hole or slit forms somewhere.  Also, the fit is so variable on Levi's.  I ordered 2 pair of the same size.  Of which 1 pair fit perfectly and 1 pair was very snug.  The only way to rectify this is to wear multiple times without washing, so I wear them on a \"clean\" outing for 3 or 4 times in a row, careful not to soil them.

My only minor complaint is that the hood doesn't have two layers so when you wear it you have the \"fleece\" side of the fabric in your hair.

My old 559 jeans do not need to a belt and these do. My actual waist is a inch or two bigger than 32 and while these sit below the waist and there is a lot variance between wait size and hip size (where these actually rest on) among people, I do not understand why Levi felt the need to increase the waist size.

I'm about 5'8 155 and wear a 31x30. The Vietnam version fits me well while the Bangladesh version is large in the waist and has a slightly longer inseam. I need a 30x30 in the Bangladesh Indie Blue. Anyway, these jeans are relaxed but not baggy. The 18 inch leg opening is what I like because it covers the top of my shoes just right.

I previously worked in the men's clothing industry as a buyer, and sales person for suits and the like.  The waist size is accurate for what you would be measured.  The rise is a graduated rise, so us shorter men the 30\" inseam will have about an 1\" shorter rise which eliminates the bagginess that I have come to expect in casual pants.  These fit great and actually fit all the way around.  For $20 a pair I am quite impressed.  Will defiantly purchase again.

Shame on Levi's for slacking up on their quality control, I have worn the same size for decades and used to be able to just pick them up off the shelf and count on a perfect fit.

Just to make sure that the trousers don't go up too high, I just wear it a tad bit below my belly button level and there are no regrets. This should not be a showstopper for me. I have tried around 5 to 6 different types of jeans brands till date and I like the relaxed fit model of Levis the best. It's not because I am a Levis fan or so. Just that their models are very comfortable and fit my anatomy. If given a chance to select jeans other than Levis then I'd prefer getting one stitched in India by buying the cloth. Yes you got it right. In India we still have tailors and there are many who really do their job very well.

As always with Levis you can buy three pairs the exact same size and get 3 pairs that all fit differently.  39.99 seems to always be about the going price either on Amazon or on sale at a local dept store.  My last two pairs I purchased on Amazon fit quite well so this rating gets 5 stars.  I currently have another pair of 32 x 32's that are so tight they are uncomfortable.  I miss the old days when they were made in the U.S. and were better and more affordable.  Now they come from a multitude of foreign countries which I'm sure adds to the inconsistency in size.  I'm not sure how they size them now but back when I wore 31 x 34's in the 501's I always wanted a size 31 x 35 and they didn't make them.

He loved working on cars, home-remodeling, tinkering on things in the garage, etc.  Now, at 92, while he doesn't stay so busy, he still prefers Levi's to wear.  I noticed that every single pair he had were so worn out but he refused to let me recycle them and continued to wear them, even though he had practically new pants made by other manufacturers.  Finally, I decided to go shopping and pick up a couple new pairs of Levi's for him.  He has an unusual size so it wasn't easy to find in stores and I was shocked by the prices!  I thought about Amazon but due to his unique size, dismissed that as too good to be true.  Then, a couple months later while shopping for another item, I noticed a sale on Levi's men's jeans.  When I saw the size my Dad wears ON SALE, I was thrilled.  I just wish I had a picture of my Dad's face when he opened the package!!  The fit was great, the fabric was the same hearty quality but the price was about half that seen everywhere else."},

I have bigger, athletic legs only being 5'9\" 190 lbs, but a smaller waist (I use a belt still on 32's) and I like a fitting jean, not too loose and not skinny jeans.

They shipped in a sealed plastic pouch so there was very little packaging waste. When I opened it the jeans were perfect and exactly what I had ordered.

Guess I have kinda short legs too cuz even wearing size 34x29 there's still enough extra length in the legs to cuff them 2-3 times (which I'm ok with...I tend to wear all pants cuffed). I prefer jeans to ride a little higher on my waist...not feel like they're hanging off of my ass also. This particular cut of jeans seems to hit all the marks. They are roomy in the seat/crotch/thigh area but have a slight taper at the bottoms. The 34x29s on my frame are tight enough that I probably wouldn't need to wear a belt.. but not too tight to be uncomfortable. If I gained another 5-10 lbs id probably have to size-up.

A traditional American-cut relaxed fit jean!", "review_body": "Call me old-fashioned, but I am not interested in acid-washed, pre-softened, skin-tight or fancy-pocket blue jeans.  Give me American-made, traditional cut, no frills, thick denim blue jeans.  I prefer to wear them in myself.  These are perfect for that.  They are relaxed fit, so there is a little extra room for you, and they are cut to be WORN, not to be \"fashionable\".  You want comfort and fashion, buy a pair of chinos or dress pants.  I will keep my jeans."},

These look great at first wear and get better with age!", "review_body": "I will have to admit I did go to a local store and try on this version of Levis relaxed fit jeans prior to purchasing on Amazon because their price was simply unbeatable.  The jeans in the store fit perfectly and the jeans delivered fit just as well.  I really like the blue color of these Medium Stonewash.  It is just aged enough to make them look like they are just beginning to break in.  The fit for me is ideal.  I am very athletic so I do not like jeans that fit tight through the thigh area.  These have the perfect fit for me because they allow to sit and stand without riding up or feeling confined.  Also, the rear of these jeans have enough definition that it does not look like they are just hanging on me despite them being a relaxed fit cut.  I can easily dress these jeans up by wearing a tucked in polo shirt or oxford shirt and nice shoes or dress them down by wearing a t-shirt and running shoes.  I have now had these for about 6 months and even with washing them once a week they have maintained their great fit and the color has not even started to fade.  I highly recommend these Levis and their Amazon price cannot be beat. Out of an abundance of caution you may wish to go to a local store to try on the different styles and cuts of Levis before buying them on Amazon just to be sure the fit you are buying works for your body type.  Of course Amazon offers free returns on its clothing so you could also go that route too.  I just do not like to deal with the trouble of returning stuff and then having to re-order."},

The synthetic moisture-wicking fabric keeps me nice and cool and does not stick or cling when I sweat. Something to keep in mind is that you'll need to remove the shirt promptly from the wash and not let it spend much time in contact with itself or any other moisture-wicking fabric while wet, otherwise the coating that helps wick moisture away from your skin will be damaged. It's super simple though, just wash all clothing of that type together and hang dry indoors or out. The construction is good and the shirt has maintained it's shape and color over the past two years. You are paying a bit more for the brand name I feel, but I've used Under Armour stuff a lot and believe the quality they provide is worth the price."},

This shirt is excellent quality, the sizing is perfect, it was similar to the designer brand I bought years ago, and very soft. The cost is low.

It's also a bit slimmer fitting than the CK.  Waist is spot on.  I'd say this is a bit slim for a relaxed jean.  I did wash it once, and there is no perceivable shrinkage.  I think the material is a bit rough.  The grey color has a bit of a rougher texture than the blue color.  Not sure why.  Also, I'm very sensitive and like really soft jeans.  These aren't that soft.

I will get some for my Son too. My wife likes the way they look. I will use them daily at the office. Not sure if they will hold up to wash, drying w/o shrinkage. Will update if a prob. Another prob. I had w/ Dockers is the fraying on the bottom. It sure seems to happen fast. If it happens here, I will update. Downside is you don't get to try them on first.

They are made of 60% cotton and 40% polyester. The cotton part makes them soft and  the polyester makes them wrinkle resistant which 100% cotton isn't. Polyester also doesn't get as dirty either, I've found. The pockets in back have buttons. One odd thing I couldn't figure out was why one of the pockets in front has like a little pouch in it at the bottom. For loose change perhaps? It's not very big and that's the only thing I could think of. It has a 4\" zipper and button for closure and it does have belt loops. Machine washable and line dry or tumble dry on low. Made in Bangladesh. These are nice enough to either be worn casual, to work in, and if you put with a nice dress shirt they would even look quite stylish and dressy."},

They are black, but the color looked faded when they were new and it did not hold the black color after washing.  They continued to fade. There is a lot of room in the leg, measuring 9\" across at the ankle and 11\" across at the thigh.  They have a more conservative style. There is a slip pocket that button close on each side of the back of the pants. The belt loop is a standard two inches wide.

Movement is easy and unrestrictive, as the material moves well on the skin, no grabbing or pinching.  The size, 34-30, is exactly on the mark.

I wear a 30L in all my other pants and they fit great, but the 30L I got in these pants were an inch or two too long. Unfortunately they are too baggy and long to wear in a professional setting, which is what I needed them for.

These are definitely \"relaxed fit\", very casual, so be sure that's what you want. I don't want to focus too much on the specifics of the style, because I think that depends mostly on trying on the jeans and checking out yourself in a mirror. So, I'm going to write about what I find helpful - does the wash of the jeans look like the picture? and what does the fabric feel like? (because if you've looked at Levi's before you know the denim ranges from pretty thin to very chunky). So, the wash in the picture is not exactly representative of what I received - the two pairs I got aren't as dark as the dark areas in the picture and the light areas aren't as light. So, overall, a little less contrast and a little lighter blue than the picture. They come off a little more Dad-ish than I had hoped, but not overly so (plus, I'm a Dad, so I guess the shoe fits). The denim is definitely one of the thinner variations I've seen on the 559. Personally, I prefer the thinner denim for the added flexibility/comfort, but, in my experience at least, the thinner denim wears out a bit quicker.  Overall, I think this is a nice wash, but I would have preferred something with slightly more contrast and the fabric suits my preference."},

One of the belt loops ripped off in the rear on the bottom and just hangs in the 60 days of wearing them and at 57 I don't stress that much. Now one might think I did it somehow by catching it on the door knob but the Levi 560 I purchased earlier in the 2016 did the same thing and it can't be a fluke. Sorry but saving money on cheaper material is taking what was an American classic to another cheap foreign made knock off even if is made by the same company. R.I.P. Levi because what was once great about our proudly made in the USA jeans has faded away into shadow of what it once was.

The fit was a little bigger than I expected, but this is a BEEFY shirt so I should not have been surprised. If you are a larger guy, especially in the arms, this shirt might fit the bill.

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Great work shirt!", "review_body": "I have 4 of these shirts that I bought to wear as work clothes. They've lasted me over a year so far and that's pretty impressive to me because these shirts have held up to a lot of grinding and welding sparks, grease and oils from steel mills, and multiple years and gold from sharp metals at work. My Grey Henly style one is by far the softest for whatever reason, and has help up the best out of the 4. The other three are all coming apart the hems at the base of the shirt and for some odd reason my top button on my black one doesn't stay buttoned. I definitely recommend them, very cozy shirts, especially the henly style shirts. I'm 6'1\" and 140lbs, being tall and lanky makes it difficult to find clothes that fit nice, these aren't tight or baggy on me. If the hemming at the bottoms held up better it would've been a 5 star rating hands down, but I can't knock them too much because they've handled a lot of abuse over the past 15 months!"},

It's thick and comfortable, but I can't see myself wearing this without an overshirt due to the odd cut. I'm curious to see if the medium has a baggier chest without baggier arms.

The zipper is very different!  The actual tab you use to zip and unzip is very distinctive on real Levis.  They have a raised notch stamped into them and the Levis logo engraved into the tiny tab.  The ones I got were just a flat copper tab, no notch, no logo.  And the biggest giveaway, the fit!  I'm use to my 550's fitting loose but comfortable but these fakers were tight around the leg and fit terrible around the waist.  Like I said, one pair was the real deal and I was able to compare them side by side.  Unfortunately, I noticed these things when I first put them on...after I had washed them like I do with all of my clothes.  So of course I could not return them.  Spend the extra and go to your local mall and buy the real deal.  I hope these are not what Levi's is cranking out these days."},

But apparently the relaxed fit makes them larger than the stated size so they are a bit too large even though I ordered them to be a little small.  My original review stated that they were somewhat large but after measuring the waste band I discovered that the real measurement was 3 inches larger than the stated size.  I now wonder if they were mislabeled as opposed to the relax fit style.  The rise of these pants is supposed to be \"below the waist\"  but I found the rise to be a little too high for my body type."},

I'm the kind of guy that's just not ok with stretchy jeans. If youre into that sort of thing, these may be for you. Anyways, they did have a decent weight to them and the waist fit ok while the inseam was slighty long. I got the feeling that when they stretch out a little, they would be too big. I'm about 5'8 150 by the way for a reference point. They are made in columbia and seem to be well made. So overall they seem to be quality jeans, just not for me."},

One word of caution: the sizing is printed white on black on the label, and is not obscured by the wearing of a belt, so if you are a bit of a self-conscious fatster, these may not be for you.  Alternatively, you can colour the white sizing in with a black permanent marker.  Problem solved!"},

If so, this review has been tailored for you (shirt pun indented and I worked very hard for it and am proud of it). Maybe you are considering purchasing this shirt so you can get in shape. If that is indeed your quest, then cast your gaze upon the product picture. This could be you. Of course, you will need to put in hard work and actually exercise, but having the right tool for the job is imperative. Did Washington cross the Potomac with a pool noodle? Did Tyler Perry become a millionaire with a cheap wig? Did Alexander the Great use a sword made out of balloons by a poorly paid clown? I don't know. But I do know that this shirt is the right tool for the job. It is breathable without being breathtaking. LETS BE HONEST. Most of you want to know if your nips are going to show through this. Probably not a lot, unless you had the name Pepperoni Patrick around the pool growing up cause you were one of those kids who would always swim with a white t-shirt on. If you get the shirt in black, you might sweat more in the sun because black attracts heat (that's just called science people) but the benefit is that you might sweat more fat off. Also I don't know if any of you are into the Ninja arts and I don't want to know for legal reasons but black is a perfect color (not-color? idk. science) for being a ninja and with the UA breathability technology, you won't get Ninja Pits.  I don't know if ninja pits is a thing but I hope it is a term people start using."},

I specifically went out of my way, double checked what I ordered to make sure it said cotton in the description. I even read reviews for the shirts I ordered and people said how they were happy with the way the soft cotton feels and all this other crap. Also, I went out of my way to even checked that the cotton shirts I own were the same ones I ordered same \"heat gear\" \"loose\" and 100% cotton because I absolutly hate polyester.  So I get home my gf already got the package which contained other stuff for her as well. So she took the shirts out, had them washed, and was excited to give them to me.  I couldn't be any more pissed when I immediately with out even touching them realized they were not what I wanted. I took the time to make sure I got exactly what I wanted and my luck or Amazon's mistake (def Amazon's mistake) I get two shirts that I will never wear. The tags n stuff it came packaged in was already in the garbage (that's my luck). So basically I realized why I never ever ever will order clothes online even if I have the same shirt (which is the only reason I did) because I always end up with something I don't want. I could be a dirt bag n pick the stuff out of the garbage but in the event they throw it on a shelf n re-sell it can't do that so I'm gonna eat this one. On a side note, the shipping info when I click on the shirt I ordered does say 100% polyester which I know I did not originally order (but good luck proving that right?)"},

UA \"loose\" is not that loose. the fit is right for a casual tee. as far as the \"performance\" aspect, it does what it says it does. wicks and keeps you cool. gotta pay a little bit for the logo I guess, but it is a solid tee. made in Honduras, fwiw."},

It's made of great material, softer to the skin than some of its competitors, but its very minuscule in difference. These workout shirts are all light and wick sweat off the body, and unlike UA's Coldgear shirts, these do not stand above the offerings of other brands as strikingly. Nike's Pro Combat, Tek Gear's Wicker shirts, Adidas Climalite, etc all do the same thing, and I don't really notice the difference. It's not like these shirts can stop you from sweating and feeling hot. Basically, these Under Armour shirts are nice and good quality, but you can't go wrong with any of these.

Since there was no tall option, I ordered 4XL. Normally those are freaking kites on me. I was afraid that I'd feel like my shirt would fly off during a bike ride. This one though? Short and a bit tight. I understand compression but I've had compression clothes and they felt different.

On these jeans that measurement is 27 inches.  This means the jeans ride two inches below the waist at best.  I have to constantly tug at them to try to keep them on.  Every time I sit or lean over, they slide down.  Once I lifted a box from trunk of car and walked into house and leaned over to set it down and the pants fell down completely.  Fortunately it was my house.  I went back to see if I had overlooked this critical dimension and could find nothing in the description to warm me of this design 'feature.'  I realize women have been wearing pants below the waist for some time, but I want my jeans to come to my waist where they will fasten comfortably and stay up!  Beware of ordering these jeans."},

Why? Well the quality of the sweater was fine. It's what came with it that has made me angry. First, I noticed a hole in it's packaging, the hole looked like it had been punctured with a finger. I didn't think much of it because I understand wear and tear can happen during processing, but when I took the sweater out of the packaging I noticed it had white specks on it. Upon closer inspection I noticed it was flakes of dandruff and I became BEYOND DISGUSTED! The hole has made me come down to the conclusion that whoever handled my sweater put their dandruff in it on purpose.

This however, was smaller than I thought it would be. Have you ever seen a shirt/jacket that looked too wide in comparison to how long it is? Well that's what I thought when I saw this. It is a wide jacket with lots of extra room or 'puff' in the chest and stomach region. But in terms of length, it came to about my hips. And as far as the sleeves go, they're a tad too short.

They've had a problem for at least the last decade though, and it's getting worse.  There is absolutely no sizing consistency between individual pairs of jeans.  It's almost like the company stacks up 20 layers of material and tries to cut out all twenty pairs at once.  Of course, one can well imagine this wouldn't work.  This problem is not solely on jeans purchased from Amazon.  It exists no matter where we procure the items.  I realize that Levi manufactures the jeans in multiple countries.  The problem exists even on the same style made in the same location.  Amazing.  I'd guess that 3/4 of the jeans that we purchase now are returned to the seller for sizing inconsistency problems.  On top of this, the material used to construct the jeans seems to be getting thinner and it wears much quicker.  Levi is no longer the quality that it once was.  After 30 years of being 100% Levi loyal, it's time to move on."},

I'm sad to report that over the last couple of years,the Levis 550 jeans that I've purchased religiously have had a sharp drop in quality.  Even though I'm less punishing to my jeans than I was when I was younger, the area around the back pocket rivets shows signs of wear after a way too short period of time. Once the area around the rivet begins to unravel, the pants begin their way-too-early transition from good looking jeans to \" wear me only when doing yard or cleanup work\" jeans. I kept buying the 550's thinking that it was probably a short term aberration. It was not. Sad to say I will start looking around for a new brand of jeans once this latest pair begins it's too quick transformation to \"crap\" jeans."},

I'm currently into the darker color 550s. I was going through some clothing I had not worn for 20 plus years. Found a few 550s made in the USA that was stored since the early 90's. The difference in materials is like night and day. The new ones are like paper thin compared to the ones from yester year.  It was heavy duty quality material back then VS a cheaper thin light feel 550s of today. IMO. I don't think these will last too long. But I love the color.

They cost a bit more, but (to purloin a phrase) I'm worth it!"},

The seams were straight and the zippers installed correctly. Some minor overstitch problems with one pair but a few seconds with the scissors took care of that.

Unfortunately this is no longer the case. I purchased these back in March of 2011 and the first thing I noticed is that there are fewer belt loops and they don't fit like they used to. If you are a slob who wears his jeans hanging halfway down is rear end these jeans are for you! If you are going to work or play in these jeans and and give them any kind of wear and tear at all, find another brand. Plain and simple, these aren't the Levi's we all grew up with. They are not made in San Francisco, the design and fabric used is inferior. and I cannot get even a year out of a pair anymore. Levi's used to be known for quality, durability and shrink to fit comfort. These newer ones though not tight are coming loose in the seams and popping belt loops too which is a problem caused by poorer reinforcement of the stress points on the belt loops and the seams and the fact that fewer belt loops need to handle greater stress from the belt and normal movement.  I do believe I have purchased my last pair of Levi's and will be buying Carhartt and other brands instead!!! It's truly a Shame!!"},

So unless they get their act together, it's no more Levi's for me... I have found a substitute... They are a tad more pricey, but fit well.
