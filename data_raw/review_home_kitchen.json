I\u2019ve ordered cartons of the Bounty Select-A-Size paper towels in the \u201cFamily 2 rolls/package\u201d from Amazon for several months now and been very happy. When I placed my most recent order, there was a message on Amazon\u2019s webpage that said \u201cthis item has been replaced with a newer model\u201d. Unfortunately the \u201cnewer model\u201d has 15 fewer sheets/roll and costs $1.02 more/carton. The only way to distinguish between the original Bounty rolls and the \u201cnewer model\u201d Bounty rolls is that the original ones say \u201cSelect-A-Size\u201d on the package and the \u201cnewer model\u201d packages say \u201cQuick Size\u201d.

I have seen pictures of slouchy under filled pillows on pinterest so if that is the look you are going for, you should go with something a bit smaller, but I think that the 20 x 20 pillow and 18 x 18 cover combo is pretty standard. This is a great product, there are ones out there that are a bit cheaper but spend the three dollars extra and get this pillow insert because the quality is acceptable for the price. If you are looking to sleep on this pillow, you may want to opt for something a bit more expensive, but if you are using it as a throw pillow this is perfect and there is really no reason to splurge on anything fancier."},

My 22\" cover could have easily used a 24\" stuffer, which might even have filled the currently hollow ears.

I folded the entire light strands (width wise) in half in an attempt to double the amount of lights (light strands closer together). It worked for the purpose of the look I was going for. If you want the light strands far apart, say for a wedding wall, then this is perfect. If you don't like them far apart, I would recommended buying double the about you're thinking and lapping them one over the other. Still a great purchase and I do not regret this purchase.

I purchased three of them so that I could have one in the background and one to the side and another in front of the subject to shoot through. The results are singular and portrait perfect.. If you like playing around with lighting and getting creative, get a set of these and start experimenting. I only wish there was an on and off switch built into the controller, but there isn't. It's just a mode-selector. You have to unplug it when you want it off.. It's nice a tall, I have them suspended from an 8' tall cross beam and they still barely touch the floor, so nice and long, easy to store when not in use..

Also, I've tried to not let it run out of water when I'm in the middle of steaming... this is actually difficult to watch for as the reservoir is small and can only steam about 2 shirts before needing to pause and reload with more water.

We had purchased this scale to replace our previous Sunbeam manual , Spring loaded bathroom scale which was horribly inaccurate and deliberated for a considerable amount of time between this scale and the FitBit Aria smart scale . In the end because of the huge price difference and very positive reviews on this scale made us go with this one. Design, Construction & Build. -------------------------------------. - The scale is feels heavy for its size mainly due to the thick, monolithic glass sheet stepping surface of the scale. - All our fears or cracked or broken glass due to stepping on it frequently, bumping or dropping it were unfounded in the past year ( we did all of them !)  , so its definitely sturdy and well built. - The two tone black-sliver finish on the scale looks ultra modern and chic. - The digital readouts are large and backlit in a pleasant not-too-strong blue which is visible both in light and complete darkness. I often check my weight on the scale during midnight bathroom visits.. Long Term Accuracy. ---------------------------. - When we initially purchased this scale i used a 10 lb Rice bag to measure its accuracy and it was always within 0.2 lb of 10 lb  with repeated tests, which is very accurate for a digital scale and well suited for measuring body weight. - Another pointer to the accuracy  of this scale is that the weight that we got for our toddler son from his pediatrician using a professional balance scale matches the results we got from this scale. I tried the same accuracy test today after a whole year of use & abuse:. 10 lb Basmati Rice Bag :  Scale Measured  = 10.4 lb. 6lb  Dumbbells  :  Scale Measured  = 5.8 lb. As you can see that even after one year the scale is fairly accurate , for all I know it might be 100% accurate as well as I have no way of certifying that the 10lb rice bag or the dumbbells are infact their true stated weights.. Battery Life. ----------------. - The scale is still using the two original AAA that came with the package even after a year of frequent, daily use  so I'd say its great!. Cons. ----------. -  About the only con about this scale is that the glass surface, being glass, needs frequent cleaning as it shows water stains. we usually wipe it with a damp cloth once every week so its not too bad. If you are going worry about keeping it spotless always then you'll going to have a hard time :). Overall we are very pleased with our purchase and couple of our family friends have also purchased it after seeing it in our home and can highly recommend this scale if your are looking for a good looking , inexpensive and accurate digital scale."},

So far it has managed to weigh with an accuracy of up to +/- 0.02 lbs which is more than acceptable for a simple body weight scale. Its auto on/auto off feature has been quite convenient. Since Etekcity reached out to me and asked me to do a review, I decided to break out official Department of Weights and Measures certified weights and placed thirty pounds on the scale. To little surprise, it weighed precisely thirty pounds. For the price, it cannot be beat.. For the love of God, please do not be silly like another reviewer on here and have this scale half on carpet and half on hard surface. On second thought, don't do that with any scale. If it doesn't break the scale, it will surely wear out (and destroy) the load cell inside any scale."},

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Overall good for the price", "review_body": "We got 2 of these about a week ago. Pretty good overall. They look nice, have a very easy-to-read display, and come at a great price. just a few small negatives though. We keep then in the bathrooms and the black glass collects water spots. We have to wipe them off frequently.. And the accuracy varies up to about 2 pounds. We placed both right next to each other and they were 1.2 lbs apart. They're very dependent on the flatness of the surface they're placed on. Our bathrooms have 12\" floor tiles. Just moving the scale a few inches to straddle tiles (which have slight thickness variations) changes the reading by up to 2 lbs.  Although as someone in another review pointed out, there appear to be a deceiving memory feature built-in that snaps the reading back to the same reading it gave you last time if it's within 0.6 lbs.  So it looks more consistent than it really is.  (You can fool that \"feature\" by picking up something that weighs a few pounds every other weighing so that each new reading is more than 0.6 difference.). Bottom line - it's a good bathroom scale for home use.  But don't put much faith in the fractional pound reading.  It would really be better if the scale just displayed whole pounds rather than anything to the right of the decimal point, as it's not accurate enough for that.  But it's good +/- 1 pound.. But as long as you leave it in the exact same place, you'll get a very consistent reading."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "Not accurate when moved", "review_body": "This scale constantly gives me different readings. For example: If i put the scale down, let it zero, then get on and weigh myself i can weigh 196.2. Then i pick it up and move it to another area of our wood floor(all flat!) i get 195. I have had up to 4lbs off just by picking it up and moving it a few inches away to get a secondary measure. I cant trust the readings! How do i know which one is right. Disappointed in this product and will be returning it."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Price vs. Performance...with a tip.", "review_body": "Going with 5 stars for performance for the price. With caveat..... I find this Etekcity scale is accurate...very close to my doctor's scale, any way.  At home I weighed 202.6 and at the doctors office, 202.. More important to me is the fact that it is consistent with itself.  If i weigh myself throughout the day, i get good meaningful readings.  (See below, however).. However, the scale is designed to match your last weight within a certain period of time. No scale will weigh exactly the same all the time.  The movement of your body from one side to another will cause fluctuations as well as other factors.  Well, this scale figures if it gets a measurement within a few pounds of a previous measurement within (I guess here) an hour or 2 or so, it will give you same measure.  By the next day, not a problem, it will get your new weight.  If you weigh morning and evening, not a problem.  If within an hour or two (or three?) Then it will simply repeat your last weight...unless you reset the scale by weighing something else....I use a big thing of liquid laundry detergent if I need to weigh again for some reason. It measures the new weight, and then, after it zeroes out, I can step on scale and get new measurement.. Weighing once a day is plenty for me.  And if I want to measure twice...this scale does that we'll too.  If you want to get hour by hour weights, however, you will need to \"reset\" the scale by weighing something else...or simply hold something heavy for a measurement, then put it down and weigh again.. But, I seldom weigh more frequently, so I have to give this scale 5 stars.  Great performance for the price."},

They have a lot better absorption than store brand, but not as thick as Bounty, and not as good absorption as Bounty. I have to use more towels for wet messes than I would with Bounty, probably 1.5 times the # of towels. The rolls are considered single roll size so I go through these much faster, obviously. Which is not a huge deal breaker for me but might be for some people. These are good for food/microwave/napkins but not my favorite for spills and kid messes.

Unfortunately, most vendors cater to the crowd that want the cheaper products... That said, I ordered a box of these towels to see how they would work out.  I was actually pleasantly surprised.  They are a full size towel and the absorbency is pretty good.  Not quite as good as Bounty, but much better than other towels I have used.. With the exception of one thing, I would definitely order more of these towels.  My problem with the towels are the rolls are too small.  I want a MEGA size.

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Good value, acceptable quality", "review_body": "Basic would be the best way to describe these towels.  They're indeed microfiber and a sufficient size to be a staple in any household for quick chores that require a soft towel (dish drying, electronics cleaning, window sill wipe downs, counter top cleaning, etc).  I do find them of lesser quality compared to my first set of microfiber towels my first set of microfiber towels I purchased in October 2016.. COMPARING EXPERIENCES. The Super Thicks maintain good form in the hands since they are more robust.  They are able to soak up more liquid since they are bigger and thicker.  They hold their edges well when you fold them over, kind of like soft sponges.  You can pretty much fold them into perfect rectangles and squares.  These honestly look and feel the same as when I originally bought them even after 6 months of usage and about 25 trips to the washer and dryer.  Folding them neatly in storage looks neat, clean, and organized.. The Basics feel much more like tissues.  Definitely they do the job, but I don't feel as confident going into cleaning jobs using these.  Squeezing the water out of these feels much like a paper towel or a tissue than a microfiber towel.  These just don't hold their form as well as the Super Thicks.  After even the first trip to the washer and dryer, these curl at the edges and don't fold over neatly.  They're just not as pleasant to work with.  Folding them neatly into storage takes some time since the edges do not fold over neatly.. VALUE. Super Thicks - currently at $25 for a 12-pack (at my purchase date: $20). Amazon Basics - $17 for a 36-pack. The Super Thicks average out to around $2 per towel while the Basics average out to less than $0.50 per towel.  So, you have the classic dilemma of quantity versus quality.  Do 4 Amazon Basic towels equal 1 Super Thick?  If you do a size comparison, the answer is most definitely \"No\".  You get more bang for your buck with the Amazon Basics based on the amount of material you receive.  If you appreciate quality and care for the small details, then I would recommend the Super Thicks.  If you're just on a budget and looking just for quantity, the I would go with the Amazon Basics."},

Well, this is one of those scenarios where \"you get what you pay for.\"  Yes, they are very cheap.  But these are by far the worst feeling \"microfiber\" cloths I've ever felt.

In contrast, if I did that with these the only thing I'd be able to imagine is being molested by a 60 year old lumberjack.. These are absolutely not fit for car detailing purposes, the only things I'd consider using them on is my wheels.  They are simply too rough, and I'd be seriously concerned about damaging my paint using these.  I'd honestly rather just use off the shelf paper towels..

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "How does this compare to Costco\u2019s Kirkland towels?", "review_body": "I\u2019ve been buying Costco\u2019s Kirkland Signature paper towels in bulk for years, so was glad to try out these Brawny. How do they compare?. When holding the Kirkland towel roll side-by-side to the Brawny, they are nearly identical in size\u2014same height with the Kirkland slightly wider. The Kirkland contains 160 sheets per roll whereas the Brawny contains 140 sheets. (That\u2019s 20 more per Kirkland roll.) The size of the sheets is different, too. Kirkland\u2019s are larger at just under 7\u201d wide, while Brawny\u2019s are 6\u201d. Personally, I prefer the smaller sheets of Brawny because I often don\u2019t need that many for a quick spill. And the great thing about select-a-size (pick-a-size, create-a-size, whatever you want to call it) is that you can link more than one sheet together to make a larger sheet should you need too.. While they are both 2-ply (two layers thick), I found that the Brawny had thicker layers. When holding both sheets up to the light, there was greater transparency on the Kirkland (meaning, more light passed through it). That makes the Brawny denser, thus tougher and more durable.. To test the absorption of the towels, I used a water bottle and put two equal squirts in the center of each. Interestingly, the size of the water circle was nearly identical on both. That said, the water circle on the Brawny was rounder and more contained. This shows that the density and pattern on the Brawny is better at distributing the wetness. However, the Kirkland held its ground at containing the wetness, just less elegantly and efficiently. For larger amounts of dampness, I would put my money on Brawny. Though Kirkland makes up for this by providing the wider sheet, and at 20 more sheets per roll, it gets the job done.. Overall, the Brawny has the better quality and density, and I much prefer the smaller individual sheets. However, the Brawny comes at a higher cost than the Kirkland. If you go on Costco\u2019s site, you\u2019ll see much higher ratings for the Brawny (they sell them there to) than the Kirkland, and there\u2019s a reason for that. If money isn\u2019t an issue, then Brawny is the better purchase. If you want savings, Kirkland does a decent job."},

My girls have a pretty hard time getting a sheet and just end up tearing little pieces off, making a mess. You literally have to hold the roll with one hand, then separate the sheet from the roll with the other while pulling down.

Besides the durability, convenience of the choose-a-sheet indentations, and absorbency, the other reason I've stuck to viva is it's softness. Paper towels aren't meant to be soft, they are meant to be tough and able to clean well. Viva does that, but as a bonus is on the soft side.

We were replacing an old thinner mattress, and needed new pads that could accommodate a 13\" mattress.  I also thought it was a good idea to get something hypoallergenic, as an added nicety for guests.  I wasn't looking for anything waterproof because I didn't want anything crinkly, but when I saw these I thought they were worth a try.. These pads are very nice.  They do not add any padding as some mattress pads do, but I didn't need that with our new mattress.  They have a terrycloth top and a soft liquid-proof barrier underneath.  That barrier is not crinkly or crackly at all.  When I first washed and dried them, it took them forever to dry...I realized pretty quickly that was a testament to their waterproof-ness, that the moisture wasn't evaporating through the waterproof layer where it was balled up in the dryer.  I threw them over the shower curtain rod, and by the next morning they were dry.  The waterproof barrier is also what protects the mattress from dust mites and dead skin and all the little gross things that work their way into our mattresses over the years.  You just need to wash it now and then.. If you want to protect your mattress from moisture or other detritus, I would definitely recommend this product."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Best of several we've tried by far", "review_body": "Our dog has an incontinence issue and has leaked on our bed before. It didn't take long until the vet recommended medication. During that time we learned that not all mattress protectors are created equal. We tried the Cool Shield first, which ended up leaking very easily. Second we tried the LinenSpa Lucid which was more waterproof but not perfect. It was slightly less breathable. After this one failed we got a new mattress and I read hundreds of reviews before purchasing this one over a year ago. The SafeRest breathes excellently and hasn't leaked. I tested it thoroughly first. I also tried the Beckham which is softer and thinner but a bit less breathable. My only very minor complaint with the SafeRest is that it stains fairly easily.  Do be sure to follow instructions for laundering, never use bleach. I'm willing to live with it permanently being slightly dingy even after washing as it works so well. None of the ones i tried were crinkly, but some were hotter to sleep on. If this one goes I'll buy another but spend the extra to get a full zippered encasement. I never found one that didn't have at least some bad reviews, and  this one is no exception. If you need severe waterproof protection your only option is usually vinyl. But if you get any brand that breathes and feels good under the sheets be sure to test it in case the coating is defective."},

I'm on my 4th roll now and it still smells. The smell is so terrible I can't use these towels anymore. My best guess is that these towels were stored under frozen meat in whichever factory they came from, hence why the stench is so deeply embedded in them.

This is a great product, there are ones out there that are a bit cheaper but spend the three dollars extra and get this pillow insert because the quality is acceptable for the price.

The lights were placed between black curtain panels and white sheer panels, placing one strand every two (2) grommets, and one set of lights accommodated the entire width of the curtains.  The results are more subtle than the seller's photo, but are absolutely BEAUTIFUL!  I keep the lights on 24-7 so at night the dimming effect of the sheers creates a candlelight glow and convenient night light.  During the day there is a warm glow, even with the bedroom light on.. \u2022 Each strand is individually zip tied to the base cord preventing the base cord and individual strands from unraveling.. \u2022 Each strand is individually gathered into a neat twisty tie preventing tangled messes.. \u2022 Tangled strands are easy to untangle and the lights are tough enough to resist the shaking and pulling without any damage or disconnections.. \u2022 The power cord reaches from 4\" above my window opening to my floor with length to spare.. \u2022 The light control is located halfway between the first strand and the power adapter, very easy to reach.. \u2022 The light control is very easy to use, pressing once to change settings.. \u2022 I leave these lights for 24 hours a day and they have never gotten hot, flickered, shorted, or dimmed.. \u2022 Light cords are clear colored and visually appealing without sheers or other covering.. \u2022 LED is warm toned as described and easy on the eyes, especially for those of us who get migraines!. NOTE: To achieve the results shown on the sellers posting I would estimate two (2) possibly three (3) boxes of lights would be required..

First, I appreciate this is a simple steamer meant to steam clothing, but the instructions were just lacking. I filled the body of the steamer with distilled water as instructed and put the top on and allowed the steamer to heat up only to discover I had put the top on backwards. I grabbed the top (not the steam part, but the area where it connects) and quickly found out how hot the device gets. I unplugged the whole thing and started from scratch.. After I got the top on correctly and the water was heated I then discovered I needed to add more water because I waited too long (seven minutes) and all the water had - surprise! - turned to steam. I unplugged the steamer, carefully took the top off and added more water, then plugged it back in and waited for the steam to reappear. Thinking nothing of it, I tipped the steamer at an angle to steam my knitting project that was laying flat on the floor and was instantly scalded with boiling hot water. That sucked.. I thought maybe I had filled the reservoir too full, but I checked and it was barely halfway full. Maybe I was having a moment of stupid optimism, but I decided to try again, only I thought I would tip the steamer just partially over - nope, boiling hot water again.. I did some more research and found another steamer for the same price that promises it can be used at any angle."},

I've used it on hand-washed sweaters (cashmere and merino), t-shirts, and synthetic fabrics like rayon knits. I haven't had any issues that a few people mentioned, like spewing water. You definitely steam the garment vertically, which is how I thought all steamers worked. I just hang my clothes and steam away. If a garment needs minor steaming, I've actually held it up with one hand and steamed with the other. As for running out of steam quickly, I expected that. It is handheld, therefore small, so of course it can only hold so much water. (I use filtered.) I have yet had to refill it before finishing a garment or two. I've never done a dress, but I have done pants.. I would not use this for business attire, i.e., men's dress shirts. It just isn't designed for that, but it has really simplified my morning routine on workdays.

I thought they would be difficult to use but the hardest thing about this one was twisting the lid off to put the water in. Even that was not very difficult once I got over the fear that I would break it.  I have weak wrists and hands so a lot of effort on my part does not equal a lot of effort on most people's part.. I did have to be careful not to tilt the steamer too much when I was using it, otherwise water comes out the nozzle and dribbles on the clothes.  This was something the instructions had warned about.  I just forgot while I was concentrating on maneuvering it to get some wrinkles out.  The steamer does allow for a little tilting, but too much allowed some of the water in the reservoir tank to drip on the clothes.. I found that it took more steam to get some of the wrinkles out than I expected.  Some of that is no doubt because of my total inexperience.  Some is probably because this is a home steamer and not a commercial steamer. In any event, the 10 minutes worth of steam went very quickly.  However,  it was easy and quick to add more water and continue with the steaming.. I found the instructions and directions that came with the packaging to be straightforward.  I had no trouble following the directions in order to disassemble the steamer to add water, and found the instructions on how to use the steamer to best advantage on wrinkled clothing to be helpful.  For instance, I followed the directions which said to steam my clothes while they were hanging up rather than laid flat and found that this worked very well.. All in all I would definitely recommend this product."},

The steam emits at a set pace and you cannot adjust less or more output. It is what it is.. -The tank evaporates pretty quick. It's a travel steamer so plan on 5-8 minutes of use. They say 10 minutes, but that's stretching it in my opinion.. -You need to plug it in to use it. This is more of a desire than a complaint, but to be completely \"portable\", you'd think wireless would be the direction you'd aim for.. Now on to the good stuff.. -The ease of use is great. Plug this thing in, add water, wait 53 seconds, now steam your clothes. Done.. -The portability is great. This thing will fit in a carry-on bag if you need.. -The cost is worth the product. I don't know much about steamers, but this shouldn't break the bank.. If I have more thoughts, I'll update the review, but I give it a 4 out of 5 stars because there is nothing quite like this, but the technology needs to keep progressing.

The water inside, likely due to the leakage, doesn't even last for one small garment.  The leak coming out the steam end is hot enough to burn slightly, causing the use of this item to be done only with extreme caution.

I moved both scales around my bathroom floor in six different places, in the center of the tile so that the scales were on the center of the tile and and not going over the edge touching the grout lines. The scales were on even surfaces in all six places. I did calibrate the Elekcity too.

The weight it measures will vary depending on how and where you stand on it. If you want to weigh more, stand or just favor your weight a little on your heels. If you want to show less weight, then do the same towards your toes. If you want a consistent measurement, then try to stand in the same place in the same way every time. Also note that these \"adjustments\" can carry forward even if you are not leaning or favoring a side if you simply had done so last time. Stand in the middle, 181 several times in a row, lean back once and get 183, get back on and stand straight in the middle and now it's always 183. \"Reset\" by moving forward and it's either back to 181 or maybe even drops to 180 now and shows that consistently.. The decimals are also misleading in terms of how granular the measurement is. I don't think I've ever seen an odd number appear after the decimal point..

I didn't want to spend very much though, so the Etekcity caught my eye.. I tested it out when I got it, and compared my weight on it to the two other scales I have and the Etekcity was spot on to them on the same level surface in the same part of my house, maybe with a variation of like  .2 lbs but as the older scales don't show increments precisely like a digital scale I'm inclined to think it's not so much a variation as it is just being able to properly see the exact weight. I also weighed a few different objects across all three scales and weights remained the same there too. So accuracy is great here.. It feels really sturdy, which is important. I know tempered glass is strong and I'm nowhere near the max weight limit but standing on glass still kind of trips me out a little. I have noticed a little wobbling on the scale but my house is very old so it may be an ever so slightly uneven floor issue.

Like the glass just randomly exploding. So far, so good there. It weighs pretty accurately. My only complaint is every now and then it'll give me different amounts. Not huge differences. But for example. In the morning I weighed myself and it says 157.5. I think, that can't be right. What?! But accept defeat because maybe I did gain weight or that I didn't lose any weight even though I've been trying and feel lighter. So 30 minutes later I decide. I'll just check it again to make sure because it just doesn't seem right. And my second weigh-in comes around 155.2. So I weigh myself a few times after that back to back to see if it changes and it stays at that 155.2. I'm not sure if this is something with the product. But I'm pretty sure you don't lose almost 3 pounds in 30 minutes. It's not that big of a deal to me because I'm getting a general idea of my weight and ever since that time of getting different weights, I weigh myself 2 or 3 times in a row to make sure I get the same number. About 95% of the time I do. But it's just something for a consumer and/or Etekcity to know. It'd be nice to have a 100% accuracy on the scale readings."},

So even though the Brighton sheets are shorter you still get more bang per roll. We never use 100% paper towel absorbancy. The Plenty was costing us $.015 while the Brighton rolls are $.014 per sheet.

For example - blue is to clean/buff my stainless steal appliances in the kitchen.

The absorption is great! my husband watered some of my house plants we have in the kitchen and one of them was so dry that the water was coming out of the saucer at the bottom. We didn't have anything around at the time to clean the water and to prevent further damage, used one of these microfiber clothes because it was close by and it quickly absorbed all the water!

These plates seem much bigger at 10 1/16th inch. The plates have a cute multi-colored triangle design on them. I honestly don't care about the design so much as the functionality of the plates. The plates are nice and deep and they are thick. They will hold a decent amount of food and you don't have to worry about a little juice or liquid leaking through. I have even cut a quick cucumber or hot dog on them (not really recommended if you are cutting more than a few slices though).. This listing is for 220 paper plates. This is a lot of paper plates and the box they come in will be a little heavy. I personally, love to buy a lot and have them in the house. Since we use mostly paper plates, it is always aggravating when you realize you just used your last one and don't have back up. These plates will last our family for a few months.. These are good paper plates and they are great for parties where you already have enough of a mess to clean up without having to wash plates too. However, I still like the 9 inch plates better. The 9 inch plates feel a little more sturdy in my hand. They also help with portion control. When you have a huge plate, you feel obligated to fill it up more.

They are deep enough to keep food from easily falling off the sides when walking with your plate. Dixie says they are five layers thick and they definitely feel thicker than the cheap plates I usually buy. They aren't as thick as say Chinet, but they are plenty thick enough for ordinary meals that don't require using a steak knife.. They have an interesting, colorful, diamond pattern printed on each plate. Not my favorite but it's OK and after all, you throw them away..

Even when manually unwinding the next towel from the roll I would often tear the towel in the process.  It was that \"stuck\" to the roll.  In other words a towel dispenser is virtually useless apart from giving the roll a place to reside without falling over.. So I am going to go back to my Bounty paper towels that may not be as \"good\" but are far friendlier and easier to use at least in my case."},

However, the biggest downfall and my reason for not repurchasing is that it \"sticks\" together and therefore you cannot pull one sheet off one-handed. I have two young girls (1 and 3 years old), so being able to grab a sheet of paper towel and ripping it off one handed is a must (and a deal breaker if not achievable). My girls have a pretty hard time getting a sheet and just end up tearing little pieces off, making a mess. You literally have to hold the roll with one hand, then separate the sheet from the roll with the other while pulling down. I wish these were more convenient as (like I said above) they feel quite nice. If you dont need to rip paper towel off one handed, then these would be great!

I'm not sure if it's because they're 'Choose-a-Sheet' or because they changed the structure, but they're slightly thinner and courser than they were (we had some of the former 'like cloth' to compare them to).

I've tried to stick to washable towels and try to refrain from using paper, but there are plenty of times that they come in handy. It's been 3 years of sticking to Viva, after trying different big brand paper towels before that. Besides the durability, convenience of the choose-a-sheet indentations, and absorbency, the other reason I've stuck to viva is it's softness. Paper towels aren't meant to be soft, they are meant to be tough and able to clean well. Viva does that, but as a bonus is on the soft side. Since Viva is brought to you by the makers of Kleenex, I can understand why. The best paper towel I've used so far, highly recommended."},

Get a cloth unless you want to use half a roll of Viva, and even then, the surface will still be damp.

The very best thing about these covers is no one knows there IS a cover on our bed. There is no crinkly sounds or rubber feeling. My husband doesn't feel like he is sleeping on a hospital bed cover and I don't need to worry that I'm one seizure away from ruining a $2,000 mattress.. I'm an epileptic and during a seizure accidents happen. I was beyond tired of worrying about our brand new mattress, so I purchased the best rated cover I could find. All I can say is that it works.

Thank goodness for air mattresses! After telling friends about what happened, they all suggested we get a waterproof mattress cover, explaining they'd come a long way since grandma's plastic wrapped days. I went with this cover because of the high ratings and am very happy! It arrived a day early so I had time to wash it before putting it on the mattress (which was still drying from the steam cleaning) and saw the water beading off of the inner liner when I put it into the washer as it filled with water, so that made me feel confident. I have not otherwise tested the waterproof-ness of the cover. It washed easily with a set of sheets (queen size) in a regular sized washing machine and dried in the dryer alongside the sheets. It did need a little extra time in the dryer after the sheets were dried, but it didn't take much longer. It's crinkle free, no plastic rustling or crinkling sounds when you touch it, which was honestly my biggest concern. Little noises really irritate me but thankfully this is silent! It fit my mattress easily with plenty of depth and is thin enough that my regular mattress pad still fit over it, as well as sheets without any problem. I'm very happy with this mattress cover, hopefully it won't ever be necessary again, but it was a painless $30 to spend on peace of mind vs. the cost of the mattress steam cleaning, buying enzyme cleaner, sleeping on an air mattress for 5 days and the elbow work and sniff testing the mattress to make sure it was cat-pee-free.

Prior to his fall he had never had any continence issues, but after two months in a nursing rehab center he came home with issues. And many of the new medications they have been trying on him have side effects dealing with continence.  I ordered Two extra long Twin sized mattress pads for his hospital bed and I use them both, making his bed up in layers so that if he has an accident at night I can peal off a pad, sheet, and mattress pad and the bed is already made up underneath.  I also ordered a queen sized pad to put on our bed over our regular mattress pad--for insurance, I suppose. I think the quality of this pad is excellent. It seems to wash and dry quite well. It is soft too. One night when we had gone through several layers and the only thing left was this mattress pad I just added a top sheet and fresh blanket to get us to morning--too difficult to try to move him to put on a fitted sheet. He didn't even notice.  It is a good mattress pad. If I could change anything I would perhaps have them make the SIDES of the mattress pad waterproof as well. Ol' Maximum Damage Max has managed on several occasions to spill down the side of the bed. Sheesh."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Perfect for potty training at night", "review_body": "I purchased this brand a while back as just a mattress protector for my daughters bed. Recently we have moved away from diapers at night and have had a few accidents and this has been a lifesaver; liquids never soak down to the mattress.  I am back to buy another to double wrap the bed to make changing sheets at night easier on myself; it absolutely does not need double wrapping to protect your mattress.  This also washes and drys extremely well and does not make that horrible crinkle sound that you get with plastic sheets.  I would highly recommend as a regular mattress cover but especially if you have pets or kids that are potty training."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Will save your mattress from pet pee", "review_body": "6/27/2016. *Update*. I woke up this morning to a puddle of fresh cat pee on the bed. Thankfully this protector was on the mattress so all I had to do was soak up the spot with Nature's Miracle and throw the sheets and this in the wash. NO mess. Drying does take longer because you have to use low heat, but overall this is waterproof and kept my mattress free of cat pee this morning.. Just thought I'd share.. Here's some advice I am going to share that will hopefully help you save your mattress. My trial and error.. I have 4 cats (1 female, 3 neutered males). 3 of my cats I raised as kittens and other was an adult high kill shelter rescue- so 2 of my male cats were not neutered and sprayed.  Now after lots of trial and error I have found solutions that work and am sharing them with you so hopefully you won't go through all the frustrations I did trying to clean the house of that awful cat spray stench and cat pee smell.. One of the favorite places for my male cats to pee and spray was/is the bed. I am not sure why, but I've read something about cats wanting to mingle their smell with yours, especially if they have separation anxiety when you're gone during the day.. Anyone who has tried getting cat spray smell out of a mattress will tell you that it is nearly impossible and many probably have thrown out the mattress because the smell is so hard to remove. If you don't get a mattress protector like this one on the mattress in time and a cat pees or sprays on it, you will need to find a way to clean up the pee smell (both to your senses and the cats senses) or else the cat will continue to back to that same place to pee/spray again.. Here is my solution that might help save a mattress.. When my cats sprayed the bed and this all stopped after they were neutered, except one cat is 'high strung' and the vet thinks he has anxiety issues- which means that when he gets mad at me he seeks out the bed or pillows to pee on (and no sometimes he doesn't care if I am sleeping in the bed, he will go about his business as if I wasn't even there).. The trick is to treat the pee area (once you find it) because honestly that smell is awful, who wants to sleep in a bed that smells like a skunk marinated it's stink all over your mattress? (that is what cat spray smells like, in my opinion).. Natures Miracle just for Cats- urine smell and stain remover works wonders to treat the pee/spray spot FIRST. Follow instructions there on the bottle but to treat a mattress of memory foam topper I pour a cup full of NM onto the pee spot and let it soak. Blot after an hour. Smell to see if the horrendous odor is still there and pour on another cup if it is. IF the smell is gone and all you can smell is NM, then blot and let it air out till dry before putting sheets and a water proof mattress protector back on.. You can find Natures Miracle here > and I do suggest buying a gallon bottle if you have a cat with any issues peeing or spraying.. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I3ANQ8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. Now for this waterproof mattress protector- I love it. It has saved me lots of time and cleaning when my cat decides to pee on the bed. Now all I do is wipe the spot down with some Natures Miracle, wash the pad in the washer and done. No more soaking and struggling to get the pee smell gone from my mattress. I do love how this pad keeps the pee from going through to the mattress even if I don't catch it till it's dry.. To those who are new like I was to waterproof vs water resistant- waterproof is when liquid doesn't go through material and eventually dries there. Water resistant is when the liquid will go through the material if you don't pick it up IMMEDIATELY and it will go through to your mattress and dry there if not picked up right away.. I would much rather have water proof because I can't always find where the cat peed on time and when I do find it, the spot is already dried- the stink is stronger dry.. Overall I am very happy with this mattress protector because it is not crinkly, makes no noise when we sleep on it and stays put on the bed without us and it sliding around all night long. This launders easily with the sheets and when my cat does get mad enough at me to pee on the bed, like I said, it's so much easier cleaning pee of THIS than it is the mattress or memory foam.. I'd highly recommend to everyone who has pets or kids. My 18 mo old occasionally leaks through his diaper at night, so I ordered a second one just for his crib and couldn't be happier with that.. Hopefully this has helped save someone else's bed. I wish when my cat first started spraying that someone had written a blog or review like this one tying the 2 things together- mattress protector/Natures Miracle cat pee odor remover because honestly, who has time to be scrubbing pee off a mattress anyways?. In my attached picture you can see a puddle of water I made at the kitchen sink. The water stayed right there until I of course spilled it all over myself. I am happy to say the water does not go through, not even a drop."},

That doesn't bother me and I think it looks very nice and classy in the bathroom. Much nicer than a cheap plastic scale.

I also do not use paper towels in the kitchen/home, so these will do cleaning duty, too.. Cons:. 1) Each cloth is tagged with a large paper-like care label. For my husband, this is unacceptable because it's too scratchy and I'm inclinded to agree. So here we are, ripping off all of these labels.. 2) They smell and feel weird. The care instructions say to wash with cool water before using. Normally (and with every other microfiber I've purchased) i would laugh this off. The smell and coating on them, however, was weird enough that i DID was them before using! And that only made the smell worse! And I'm not even a freak about \"chemicals!\" I actually compared them to some unused clothes I got from the home improvement store and they are substantially more coated, almost to the point of being tacky to the touch.. 3) They are not good quality and I give them a year or less in the rotation before they are thrown away. This sounds okay, but considering we have good quality microfiber clothes that are now a decade old, it's a little wasteful. I was thinking the 144-count would last me YEARS.. Pros:. 1) You get what you pay for. The bulk pricing is as cheap as I've seen, especially with subscribe and save. If you view these as fairly disposable, then you will not be disappointed.. Overall, I don't feel good about this purchase and will not buy again. I don't use paper products in the home because they're wasteful and expensive. Sadly, I think these are pretty wasteful too and they smell so weird, I wonder what part of the world they're poisoning with their production. Still, I'll make the best of it and use these for heavy cleaning. You do get what you pay when it comes to these things. High quality clothes make a huge difference. But if you cannot properly care for the high quality ones or you're using these with heavy solvents or soil, these make sense."},

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Tough Standard Trash Bags", "review_body": "Trash bags that fit a standard kitchen trash can. I like this brand - and this specific version - because my family is notorious for over-stuffing trash cans. They will pack, push, balance, slide, shake, and do any other action necessary to fit their article of trash on the pile in an attempt to avoid just taking out the trash. This means I get to do uniquely strange dances while attempting to get the bag out of the can...but that's ok with these bags. Due to the ties, there is a little additional space at the top of the bag - which helps keeps everything contained within the bag, instead of spilling out all over the floor (and me). The ties are pretty strong allowing one to shake the trash deeper into the bag than many other brands. It is easy to tie the ties - and they are sturdy enough to provide a handle with which to carry out the trash. The bags themselves are pretty tough - I have not found another brand that will stand up to similar abuse without breaking. Glad bags will stretch and expand to accommodate virtually anything. That's not to say they won't rip - they will. They are PLASTIC - anything sharp in the bag will cut and/or puncture the bag.. When liquid is thrown into the trash bag, it has been my experience that these do not leak as much - or as often. Of course, if you slide the bag across pavement or a rough surface, it will leak. Again, this is PLASTIC. It's not some special high tech material - it's a trash bag. But if you're looking for a strong trash bag that can stand up to some abuse and over-stuffing without wimping out - or worse, disintegrating - look no further. The price is good (especially for the quality), there is no strong odor to them, and they do their job. That's why I continue to buy these.. Bottom Line: Practically simple - or simply practical. They work - and work a lot harder than any of the teenagers around here. ;) Sturdy. Can take some abuse. I've never had one \"disintegrate\" - which makes these a priceless value to me."},

They may not be the most top of the line of the Glad products, but they're perfect for my everyday use. Glass and other sharp edges will puncture the bags, and you can't overstuff them like the stretch bags. But they do hold heavy waste with no issues. I empty my kitchen garbage every few days after I clean out the (automatic) litter box waste drawer, so it never gets overfull, but it doesn't get heavy-ish. No waste, not even dirty cat litter, escapes the bag. And on days I empty the whole litter box, the only problem I have taking that bag of many pounds of cat litter out the street can, is lifting it up high enough to toss it into the (way too tall) street can. I never worry about these Glad bags bursting or breaking.. (There's another version of these bags, scented with Febreeze. Avoid those. They stink to high heaven in a cloying gross way. Unscented is the way to go.)"},

The fit isn't ideal for my simple human 40 liter trash can so I have to deal with a little bag showing around the top lid and they still feel very inferior compared to the trial pack of simple human bags that came with the trash can. Both minor issues especially considering that the simple human bags are three times the price of these!. UPDATE 12.02.15. Changing my review to a 5 star. Have almost gone through an entire box of 90 bags and not a single rip, tear or leak to date, including the times I overfilled it. The patterned stretchy material in the middle really does work.

First impressions, \"that's a big box!\" I didn't think about storage of my paper towels. This is Costco sized box of paper towel. I was hooked on these paper towels from the first pull from the roll. The paper towel actually ripped along the perforation. Not just part of the way, but the whole length of the paper towel. I was so impressed that the paper towel just didn't rip in half like most other products that I ripped off 5 more sheets and each one ripped only along the perforation. These paper towels have a good thickness to them. It just feels like you can handle a large mess. I felt I had the power to clean a spilled plate of spaghetti from the couch or a puddle from a 64oz big gulp from the floor of my car. These paper towels are tough as they feel while feeling soft, but not too soft. Just the right amount of tough and soft. I use them regularly to clean my seasoned pans. With the thickness of these paper towels, they are quite absorbent too. As far as smell goes, they have that good paper towel smell. I'd say if you're looking for a better performing paper towel, to give these a try. Maybe don't buy a giant box like I did, but pick up a couple rolls and see for yourself.

It did not go through, our mattress was not wet. YAY! So we go to bed. I was a little worried it might be crinkly or noisy, as some customers had reported. It didn't *feel* that way, but I could definitely tell there was a lining underneath. Thankfully my worry abated as soon as I crawled into bed. I couldn't tell at all! And I haven't noticed it on other nights either. I am definitely happy with this purchase so far. My only concern - and it's minor - is how the lining will hold up when I wash it.

I needed a new digital scale quite a while ago, and I always try to look for the best quality for the lowest price, and I think this is it. I've had it for about 6 months now, and I guess I generally use it once a week or sometimes more, so it gets regular use. It needs AAA batteries, which is slightly annoying because I feel like I always have AA on hand but not AAA, but it comes with two of them, so it's fine.. You do have to use it properly to get the proper results, so I do also sometimes get slightly different numbers, but when I'm making sure I use it correctly, it works perfectly. I have wood floors, so that's good for me, but just remember that you cannot use it on carpet or anything that has a give because it won't be accurate. You have to wait for the numbers to blink before you get the final result. If it seems way off, step on it and let it blink then go back to zero and try again. That zeros it out at the proper number. Sometimes I have to do this for no particular reason, maybe because I keep it stored underneath a table, and when I pick it up and movie it, it un-calibrates it or something, I dunno, but I think that's fairly standard for any digital scale like this.. So I think it works accurately as long as you use it right. I like the back lit numbers, they make it easy to see. It's glass, but I guess it holds a ton of weight, so don't be worried about that. I also like that it's a .1 scale so that's a more accurate number than just a whole number and you can see even a little bit of progress. Of course, your weight can fluctuate daily, or even hourly, so I wouldn't rely on any scale to tell you down to the ounce what you weigh, but it does give you a very accurate measurement at the time of usage.

I'm glad it flashes a couple times to indicate the scale is finished reading the weight, otherwise I would not know when it was done (I can somewhat see the flashing).. The other thing might be common to most digital scales. It seems to use the weight from a previous reading if it isn't too far off. Eg., if you weigh yourself, step off and weigh yourself again while holding a cell phone, you will probably get the same weight.

Between the scale at the gym, the scale at the doctor, and this scale there was only a slight decimal of difference (170.5, 170.8, 170.1). Second, the reading comes out very quickly. Some other scales may take a couple of seconds to calibrate and then you step on and wait another couple of seconds to find out how much weight registered. With this scale you step on and within a 2-3 seconds it has your weight on the display. I really like that the display lights up with a blue background which is great for darker locations for the scale (my scale is in the bathroom in the corner were is darker than most). Finally, the last scale i had died within a year from the humidity in the bathroom but this scale has no issues with water. Many times i will come out of the shower onto the scale and it has continued to work perfectly fine for over 6 months now.

Now that it has had a few months under our backs, I can say this is hands down the best cover we have owned!  We have a Full size mattress (don't judge our tiny bed...we snuggle when we sleep!) that is semi deep and have had trouble finding both sheets and mattress protectors that will stay put.  As adults, we don't want the little bedding straps to hold everything in place, so the challenge is real.  This cover fit our mattress like a glove, which was a win from the get-go!. Some key points:. - No Shrinkage.  I wash this on regular cold with bleach and dry on high.. - No pilling.  The low pile stays soft with no funky pilling balls,  I wash it twice weekly. - Durable, no rips or loose seams (see above for my abusive washing pattern). - No crinkles.  The vinyl-free construction makes this noise- free. - Resists leaks!  A red wine spill didn't seep through to mattress and bleached out wonderfully. - No slippage.  This bad boy stays put on the mattress. - No wrinkles... meaning it doesn't bunch/fold under your sheets.  The ones that do this can drive you  insane while you try to sleep.  I have been there.. This is the perfect lightweight layer to keep your mattress fresh and to help prevent mattress critters from getting to your skin.. Buy it!"},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "We made the right choice!!!!!!", "review_body": "I am beyond enthused with this mattress cover. This cover is AWESOME!. First, when I read the reviews, I noticed that others have expressed how thin it appears. Well, it is a mattress cover so of course it would be thin. If it were a mattress pad then I would agree with their statement..  I washed it at work (I work for an appliance manufacturer so I have the privilege of washing my clothes at work) on 195 degrees Fahrenheit. It washed perfectly and was clean and ready to go. I dried it on normal and it dried in no time. Our washer spin speeds max out at 1600rpm so that was a key factor as to how fast it dried. However, it passed the first test for me with flying colors.. Next, I brought it home for the mattress fitting. We have a queen size pillow top mattress. So I was worried that it wouldn't fit. Low and behold.. It did. It fit perfectly. I had some room to tuck the remainder underneath the mattress for a complete fit.. I don't drink anything in bed except for water at night. But I am very cautious to not get anything wet. But I can assure you that liquids will not penetrate this cover. We have a warranty on this bed that is still in effect. But the warranty will only cover the mattress as long as it's protected with a cover. So we didn't want just any mattress cover.  It doesn't move while sleeping or when changing the fitted sheet. It stays in place!. In conclusion.. We made the right choice!!!"},

It arrived quickly and fit our 59.75\" x 79\" (and 12\" thick) mattress easily. I was concerned about it being squeaky or noisy since it did make crinkle sounds as I put it on the mattress. Honestly, once the sheet was placed over the pad, it didn't make any noise at all.. I haven't noticed any heat retention issues, either.. It hasn't moved, hasn't pulled off, hasn't shifted in the slightest bit.. I am completely satisfied with this item and am glad the mattress salesman suggested it."},

I ordered this, and after 2 days (waiting for it to arrive I slept in my daughter's room- didn't want to risk the new mattress) it arrived. I am pleased with the quality, and it fits my memory foam mattress like a glove. Perfectly smooth, no wrinkles. With just a sheet on, it's hard to tell its there. The terry surface is comfortable, and you'd never suspect it's a waterproof cover- no noise or plastic feel. The first night I slept on it my dog had an accident on the bed, he rubbed his ear until it bled. Right on my sheet! It of course seeped through onto the cover. It didn't penetrate the barrier, my mattress is unblemished. It washed well (the stain came out), and held up in the dryer (no shrinking or melting, dried on low like instructions indicate).

Although more substantial in size and weight than the other steamer, it also does NOT leak when held sideways.  It steams out wrinkles of different types of fabric with complete efficiency.  It can be used with hanging or flat laying clothing, as on a table or bed if traveling.  It comes equipped with a brush as well for napped fabrics.  I find it to be an excellent, safe, and well engineered steamer.. From June 2018:. Although this handheld steamer may be perfect for travel use, it is not ideal for at-home use.  It cannot be rotated from verticals without causing boiling hot water spillage; its small capacity also means that for larger items such as jackets or long dresses, it has to be refilled more than once.

However, that line in the middle seems to be the spot.  So, if you purchase this product, step on that line in the middle and it should turn on every time, on the first try.

I store it in the plastic wrapping and styrofoam casing and only remove it once a day in the morning to weigh myself. I keep the batteries fresh and always start it on the same flat spot on the hardwood floor. However, no matter what I do, this scale is off +/- 3 lbs consistently. I usually have to move it around to 2 or 3 different places and take 5-6 reading before I begin to get an accurate reading. I weigh myself first thing in the morning with no clothes, before I eat or drink anything. Luckily, I am aware enough of my body to know on those days when I have lost a little weight overnight or if I have a few extra pounds of bloat that morning, so I can usually tell if the number is way off. I don't know if this is an issue with most digital scales, but it's annoying and defeats the purpose of having a scale in the first place."},

Yesterday, it gave me a 3 lb difference within the span of 2 minutes.  Today, same thing.  It always says I weigh more the first time I step on.  Today the first weight was 3 lbs more than the second weight and the second weight was the same as the third weight.

Many reviewers are complaining about the scale not working when placed on a carpet, but scales don't work on carpets.. The problem is the sensors that these new scales use. Most of these newer scales have 4 sensors; one in each corner of the scale; therefore, the scale must be placed on a relatively level, hard, and flat surface.. This is a great, simple scale. It comes on quickly and automatically when you step on. The output is back-lit, so its easy to read even in dark environments. It is precise within a tenth of a pound, which is really more precision than anyone needs but at least you know you are getting an accurate reading. The scale is sleek and looks good in a bathroom. Its the perfect scale for someone who just wants a scale. It seems like all scales are becoming smart scales one way or another and becoming outrageously expensive in the name of being able to track your weight automatically on your smart phone. This scale is perfect and at a great price for someone who just wants a scale.. Others have complained about the scale shattering. i have had no problems."},

I love it! It has been very accurate as far as I can tell. I weighed myself several times in a row to see if I found a discrepancy. Not one so far!. Set it to zero by tapping it or putting some weight on it with your foot - and weigh yourself. Simple!. My old digital scale saved weights of person 1 and person 2 but frankly I never used it so when it broke I  went back to the old fashioned scale. I remember how much I weigh - no need for fancy programming.. Great product and really great price..   UPDATED- 6/4/18. Just ordered another one for my Mother\u2019s house since mine is packed up. We love it. I find the weight is accurate and no discrepancies weighing myself several times in a row. It is glass so be careful where you put it..  Great scale."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Works great and very inexpensive.", "review_body": "These towels work very well for cleaning autos (inside and outside), home, and even as a hair dryer (by quickly absorbing water from the hair after showers).. When cleaning cars, I use hot water with some soap (very diluted) and these microfiber towels do a great job of absorbing the dirt and oils. Inside the home, I generally don't use any cleaning liquid when using these towels as they are able to pick up accumulated dirt pretty well just with its microfibers. Lastly, I have a bunch dried and ready in the bathroom for use after showers to dry my hair quick...much quicker than normal towels.. I am sure you can find many other uses for these towels. They are durable but just like other materials, after you wash them they do change in shape and eventually deteriorate at the edges.

You need cotton...\" I was told, and so I complied.  Expensive towels.  Oh yeah, cut off the edges so they won't trap dirt to scratch your paint, too.  After a year, my bath towels became hand towels because they'd fray in every wash.  ...and the kicker is, my car still got swirl marks/fine scratches.  I've recently purchased a car that I want to be \"that guy\" with, but I'm a bit more open to my own experimenting.  Glad I am, because these towels rock!  About fifty cents a towel...  how can you beat that for a soft towel that's a great size for washing/waxing?  Maybe not enough nap for some in washing, but I feel a lot better about tossing aside a towel that falls out of my hands while washing (don't want the dirt from the ground scratching my ride!) when I'm staring at 47 more.  Also, your days of flipping and folding when polishing/waxing/gloss spraying/whatevering are over!  Just put it in the \"done\" pile and grab another one.  I have the Meguiar's X2020 as well and the Meguiar's seem softer and are larger, but between the \"toss it and grab another one\" aspect of the smaller towel and the much greater price of the Meguiar's, these are the king of the towels from what I've purchased thus far."},

At regular price, better can be had a Costco or Walmart, but on Lightning Deal, which happens often, these are pretty competitive.. They are slightly thin and flimsy feeling, but again, for a bargain brand, exactly what you'd expect, and they don't pull or pill, which is a plus.. One major drawback - their tag. These have a big, coarse polyester tag on each towel, which doesn't easily pull off, and if you forcibly tear off, sorta ruins the towel. Leaving the tag on, it sort of scratches at the finish of what you're using this to clean or buff. Honestly not acceptable.. Others can do this kind of thing without a tag, Amazon - follow suit."},

I decided to go for broke and give them a serious test - southern fried chicken, fried corn, and bikkits with gravy.  None of that's particularly 'soupy' but it's plenty moist, and heavy enough to give a good test.. They passed with flying colors.  No leaks, collapses, or problems of any kind.  The depth makes them really good for things like spaghetti or gravies, and it also makes them a fair bit easier to hold, when needed.. One thing I thought of and tested separately - we all use our forks with biscuits and gravy, but it made me think of foods that need cutting.  If you use a serrated knife of any kind, it'll saw its way through the coating that keeps these from leaking.. Granted, surely everyone knows by now that cutting something on a paper plate isn't a great idea, but I thought I'd mention.  These are sturdy enough to do some limited cutting on, but it could defeat the liquid-proofing.. I'm pleased to note these are USA-made, but Dixie's website says these aren't recommended for home composting.  I think that should be expected for anything that says it has a water-proof coating, but is worth mentioning.. I'm not a fashionista type, but the 'geo' designs on these are nicely fresh and modern.

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Sturdy, soak proof  and not for home composting", "review_body": "Used these at an informal gaming afternoon at our home and the plates held up very well. There was no soak through from Hummus and dip and the plates for sturdy enough to hold food without needing to be on a flat surface for support.. I prefer to use paper plates instead of foam or disposable plastic for occasions when my own dishes are insufficient for the number of guests. The pattern on these are more modern than some of the flowery patterns I have used in the past and I definitely prefer this look.. On the downside, the sturdy, soak proof nature of the plate means that biodegradability takes a bit of a hit. Dixie's website states that while the plates have 91% compostable fiber, they are not suitable for home composting. They can be composted at a specialized composting facility. So into the trash bin these will go.  If you are looking for purely compostable plates, these are probably not going to fit the bill."},

The lip keep sauces from spilling off the edge. They also prevent liquids from soaking through. This set has a very pretty design. It has some color and the plate is covered with some portion of the illustration. It makes the plates more festive for parties than plain white ones. It says these plates are microwaveable too.

It's got a waterproof layer underneath the but the top is very nice soft terry cloth material so it's more comfortable and quiet.

When the protector arrived in the mail I promptly washed it and put it on the mattress with my next sheet change out. The pockets of the protector are nice and deep and I'm pretty sure they won't pop off like the old protector we had. The protector is a little crinkly when you get into bed but it doesn't disrupt our sleep. We've had the protector on for about a week now and are pretty happy with it. I don't expect it to totally block any spills or accidents (from the future children), the goal I had in mind with this protector is to help reduce the amount of liquid that gets to the mattress and with prompt cleanup I don't anticipate too many problems on that front.. UPDATE December 2016: I purchased a second mattress protector for one of my guest beds. Since the purchase of the first one for my bed the crinkling has either reduced through normal sleeping or I have gotten used to the noise. Regardless, I liked it enough to purchase a second one and the 4 star rating stays."},

On my prior more expensive scale, every time I'd get on and off I'd get a different reading.  So I'd take best best out of three!  Every time you get on and off this scale at the same session the reading is identical.. I'm currently visiting a doc weekly and I get weighed every time on her $$ professional scale that measures everything and the reading is exactly the same there as on my home scale.  I would have paid much more for this beautiful and accurate scale and am very pleased.. Following up 2 weeks later - I had the occasion to call customer service and ask a question and Jubilee was awesome and took fantastic care of me.  So not only is the scale great, but the service is too."},

Anyway, if the surface is not flat or it's at an angle, the scale will read your weight and everytime it will be completely different.

You are 0.4lbs lighter than you were yesterday morning.\". Yaaaaasss.. While calculating body fat would be a better determinant in how much fat I am losing, of course, there is no denying in looking at the numbers showing, \"160.8\" when two months ago it showed, \"179.8.\" It fluctuated every morning, but remember that there are many factors for that:. - How late you ate the night previously if you did so. That's not going to burn as fast as if you had light and had dinner much earlier.. - Any urine or other products manufactured in your body's supply chain that are being held in the distribution center waiting to get delivered the final consumer in your restroom. I'll check the scale when I get up for the day, strip down to only underwear (If you have the convenience), then go deposit urine to come back and lose a pound. Loopholes lol. Basically, the scale works great as it should. From my tips on accuracy, just make sure you set a time range for when you check your weight and match the same factors every day you do so. You'll know you're dropping lbs/kg when you are looking at your weight from week to week rather than day to day since that fluctuates heavily on numerous factors."},

The issue is that if you stand with your feet in one place, you will get one reading, but if you move your feet forward just an inch, or slide one foot further from the other, you can get at least full 1.5 pound increase or decrease for weight. I've stood too close to the front and seen an even larger increase in numbers. I'm not sure then, where that leaves people with bigger/smaller feet, or little children's feet. Also, If You move and the number changes, it leaves you wondering, which is the accurate number? I don't feel like I fully trust it."},

Over the course of the next 4 weigh-ins I was either up a couple of pounds or down close to 5 pounds from my initial weigh-in. These readings were taken over the course of 2 days. I could live with a svale that is not the most accurate in the world but a scale that demonstrates such high variance is completely useless. Consistent readings, even if inaccurate, would allow me to monitor my weight trend line. When readings are all over the place, the measurements are essentially useless.

So far I have used them for all the standard cleaning chores around the house: countertops, eyeglasses, to absorb coating of grease from cooking utensils before washing them, the espresso I managed to spill all over and it didn't even stain the white cloth.  They are soft and comfortable to use wet or dry.. Most exciting for me however, is that my dog, who has lots of long fur around her face, finds them soft enough to be willing to allow me to dry off her face, or wipe the fur down after a particularly delicious meal.  I also used one to bathe her the other day rather than having to use my hands.  They spread the soap and water beautifully and then another few to do some surface drying.  She is quite fussy and finds them acceptably soft.  (A Havanese dog with thick fur).. Needless to say, they are also not expensive, which is an added plus.  I've washed them a few times in the washing machine and then left them hanging over something to dry - which they did very quickly.  All the absorbency and softness was retained.  I've found that microfiber needs to be very thoroughly rinsed (all microfiber), and air dried - but it dries quickly.. I wish Amazon would expand on this product and create more subtle and interesting colors.  My only conceivable objection is that the blue and the gold are bland versions of the colors - Martha Stewart probably wouldn't approve :).

We clean the floor, kitchen, bathroom, everything with them. They are so much better for the environment than using paper towels. I throw them into the washer on a cold wash with plain baking soda and then wash them one more time with a tiny bit of detergent in hot water.

Fit: Overall the mattress protector fit well - somewhat baggy in corners but was easily hidden under the mattress; install was easy enough for one individual to do without pulling or snagging on any corners;. Packaging/Delivery: The sealed container was similar to buying sheets - a plastic cover with a zipper - which held the product without any major creases or odd patterns when unfolded; the packaging materials did not leave any strange or chemical smells/scents on the product which can typically be the case with linen material - I would still reccomend washing it before use;. Overall the product is a great investment to protect your mattress purchase - this product is definitely not impervious to liquid stains/spills - but you will obviously be better off in case of an incident; I would reccomend this mattress protector to anyone who is knew to the market or product type - this is a great place to start for the price.

They've been peed on a few times, and it never leaked through. At first I hung them up to dry.

My sheets would all be crumpled in the middle of the bed and it was difficult to make the bed with out pulling everything off first. This new protector is near perfect. It stays on well, is not slippery, doesn't bunch up, and stays cool. It's not noisy, it has a nice terry cloth top.

I had bought a luggage scale since I was traveling out of the country with gifts for family and needed to be 50lbs or less.

I bought this scale and it was so easy to stand on the scale, get my weight, then stand on it again holding the suitcase.

It only shows me weight in increments of 0.3 kg or 0.6 lb. I didn't care initially when it showed me the exact same weight for many days in a row. But, I decided to do a test today.. I used a water bottle to check its precision. I measured my weight with the empty bottle and got 150.0 lb. Then I filled up the bottle in small increments. The weight stuck at 150.0 lb for a while and then jumped suddenly to 150.6 lb.. Also, I have it placed on flat hard floor and never moved it. I also calibrated it like the desciption says."},

Once I started the calibration process I noticed there was an issue. I couldn't get the scale to set at 0.0 pounds. It kept reading 300 something pounds when I step on, sometimes lower sometimes higher, but never less than 200. I am a petite woman who weighs around 99 pounds, so this was very very very off.. I tried to problem solve by following the manual and looking up alternate methods online. Still nothing. I had my friend try it out thinking it was just me, but they couldn't get it to work either.. I'm sure this is a great scale if you get one that actually works. However, after this experience I'm not sure if it's worth it for me to purchase from this company again."},

Lately, however, we've started eating healthier and exercising more in order to lay a good foundation for our kids as they get older.  I had read how having a good, accurate scale and keeping track of your weight regularly can help you maintain your fitness goals, so when I saw that there was such a great deal on this scale I figured it was time for an upgrade.. I really like the size of the scale itself.  It's big enough to stand on without losing your balance while trying to check the read-out, and the bright blue back-lighting on the display makes it really convenient and easy to read.  As far as accuracy goes this matches up almost exactly with the scale at the doctor's office, which I would hope is correct.  Another great thing is the option to switch to kilos just by pressing the button on the underside of the scale.  For my wife, who grew up in Taiwan, converting everything from pounds over to metric is a real pain.  This has been a great purchase as far as I'm concerned, and I can definitely see this making the difference as we try to meet our goals."},

I think we might start using them in his bath as well because they are so much bigger and softer than baby washcloths. They wash up great and come out looking like new every time.

When I'm not paying attention I am very annoyed to find one of the garage cloths in my face towels!  The only disadvantage (which all of these types of cloths seem to share) is they act like velcro--they will grab prickly things (like dried leaves or sticks) and not let go.  So, I try to wash these in a load with other \"inside\" things.. Update 25 May 15..... These cloths continue to be somewhat repellant to water.  They will absorb water, but not without a bit of work.  I had assumed this would go away with repeated washing, but it did not.  Therefore I've dropped them one star."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Does exactly as it is supposed to!", "review_body": "For a true mattress protector, this is REALLY nice. The part that covers the top of your mattress is a PUL (plastic) material, fully encased in a nice terry cover. If you manipulate the cover a bit, you can certainly hear and feel the PUL, but it is really slight. Again, for a mattress protector, it doesn't get better than this. I've read some reviews of this cover being uncomfortable, complaints of being able to hear and feel the plastic through the sheets, etc. Don't confuse this with a mattress TOPPER that is made specifically for your comfort. This cover is made to protect the value of your mattress from the yuckies. If it's really that bothersome, I think you could probably put a mattress topper over this protector and then top with your sheets. I personally don't feel that's necessary. Also, I do not recommend washing this protector in anything but cold water. As a mom who cloth diapers and has experience with PUL products, the plastic will definitely crack and warp with hot water, any bleach products or even fabric softener."},

Was tested immediately by a child who became ill (I won't go into detail), and held up (nothing soaked to mattress).  We have it covering a 12\" memory foam mattress - so its a little taut.  I did not give it five stars because i felt it firmed up the mattress a bit, and warmed up the top cooling layer of the mattress.  As time progresses (a couple of weeks) the cover is starting to soften/stretch and the mattress getting less firm (which is good).  Not sure any cover would allow the cooling gel through unless its sold specifically as a temperature regulator.  All in all - pleased with purchase and will keep it on the bed."},

Perhaps, the terry cloth top is what will make this cover speak, as opposed to the Protect a Bed one I had, allowed moisture to soak through.

The reality is, if you want true water proof in a mattress protector, you're not going to find one that doesn't make noise. You just have to decide if the protection is worth the extra noise."},

I'm updating these pillow to 5 stars because they're actually NOT too big for the pillows I got below.  See the elephants, those have the 20x20 in them and they're PERFECT for them.  I think if you get cotton shams, that are 20x20, then get inserts that size, but if you get canvas shams that are 20x20 (with the birds on it below) get 18x18 because the canvas run smaller.. These pillows are nice but too big! I'm returning them because I do not see how my pillow shams will fit them. In the pictures I have these pillow shams (which I love by the way!) seem way too small to have these inserts fit into them. The inserts in my pretty shams are actually my old inserts and even though they say 20X20 they're made out of feather, so maybe they are smaller?. I may try to pull off one of my pillow shams but honestly, it's such a pain to get the inserts in I don't want to. I will probably just go to Walmart and get some inserts.  I ordered 4 more pillow shams, the giraffes, 2 different kinds of elephants and a peacock feather.  They will all be the same size as the pillow shams in the picture.. Anyway, I'm going to look into 18X18 inserts, I really am not a fan of stuffed pillows as much as seemingly some people are.. Overall? These pillow inserts are fine if you can fit your 20X20 pillow shams into them.  If not, aim for 18X18 pillow inserts and save some $$."},

At this point, you have to be wondering if I accidentally clicked 4 stars. Well, luckily, with the order comes a slip from Etekcity that has all the relevant contact information to customer support for you. I sent them a quick email asking if I was doing something wrong in calibrating the device (I gave them proof of purchase of course). Instead of emailing me back an instruction booklet, within 1 hour I got an email saying that a new unit was on the way to my address free of charge (with expedited shipping no less). I didn't even have to give them back the broken scale.. Needless to say, the replacement scale works great and is very consistent in the measurements. I had read other reviews that said repeated measurements gave a variance of a couple tenths of lbs. But, mine measures the same weight each time with no variance, which is very nice. It's always fun to weigh yourself before dinner, eat, and then weigh yourself again to see how much you ate. ;).

But overall I am very please, and am surprised at how well Etekcity handled the situation. Props to them."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Convenient, fast and accurate scale", "review_body": "The scale is very fast and repeatable. The lighted background makes for easy reading. The scale itself is stable and doesn\u2019t move around. The weight measurement display is continuous, showing the progression through multiple consecutive fast measurements. The scale looks for consistency in the measurements (try to put just one foot on it and you\u2019ll understand what I mean), and once it sees that required consistency it averages some consecutive fast measurements and displays a final result. Shifting your weight across the scale surface will not throw off this scale. Really the best digital scale I ever tried.. Of course, just like all other digital scales, this scale has a hidden \u201crepeatability enhancement\u201d feature. The scale remembers the last weight it measured even when going to sleep. If the next measurement is close enough to the previous one, it will ignore the new measurement and just present the previous one again as a final measurement. You can test this by weighing yourself once, and then holding a small object that will add a little to your weight for a second weighing. The scale actually measures and quickly shows the new weight but \u201cswitches\u201d to the previous measurement as a final reading. The good thing is that the decision threshold with this scale seems to be very small at ~0.5 lbs. Right away this small threshold hints at the actual repeatability of this scales measurements (or at least at its manufacturer confidence). My previous scale not only didn\u2019t show the measurement process, but it also needed to see at least a 3 lbs change before agreeing to actually show a different number.. Again, this is the best digital scale I ever tried."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great scale, no cons yet", "review_body": "I have been using this scale for a couple of months and I can't really complain.. I bought it as it was the cheapest scale that would display the weight in kilograms and had good reviews.. PROS:. - Pretty cheap. - It can display the weight in pounds or kilograms (there is a button on the back, see attached photos). - It's relatively light, so it can be easily moved around. - It's stable when you step on it, as it has rugged rubber feet. - It has auto-on functionality: you just step on it and it will immediately display the weight. - Batteries included. CONS:. No cons yet; I know some people reported that it easily shutters if a corner hits the wall when moving it, but I just placed it in a corner and never moved it so, fortunately, no problems so far. Will report back if that happens."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great scale, great price!", "review_body": "Bought this to keep track of my weight, as I'm on meds that can cause weight gain.  This product definitely helps me with that.  The blue LED display is clear and when you step onto the middle of the scale, wait a moment or two and your weight will brightly flash.  I'm about 215 lbs and it handles my weight just fine -- I don't worry about breaking it when I step on.  This unit also is consistent.  Within the period of about 30 minutes, I weighed myself three times and my weight came up the same every time.  The key is to stand in the middle of the scale with your weight distributed evenly on each foot.  Do not use this on carpet, as it will distort your readings.  I use mine on a hardwood floor.  The glass gives this a nice touch and it looks sleek.  I can't speak to the battery life, as I've not owned it too long, but it does include two batteries for the unit.. All and all, I'd say this is a great value for the price.  It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but if all you need to do is track your weight, this unit gets the job accomplished for a reasonable price.  I would definitely recommend this."},

I have found them to be incredibly useful for cleaning my apartment. I read that some people didn't like the assorted colors. This should be used to your advantage.

I have used them as such; white (will show uncleanliness first) for drying dishes, wiping counters and surfaces above waste level, and pretty much any use that could consequently come into contact with my mouth; yellow is used for floors and general area dusting; and blue only gets used in my bathroom or my outdoor patio. Recommendation: use the color variations to keep things sanitary.. These towels absorb well and they are heart enough for scrubbing. If they get nasty (bathroom usage) you can afford to just throw them away. I buy the 36-pack, so the unit cost is roughly $.45-$.50/cloth.. Paper towels can get so expensive, and they are often not well suited for many jobs. I am also trying to become more environmentally conscious.

They're the best known and best loved brand of paper towel...and for good reason.  While they aren't as soft and cushiony as some other brands, they're extremely tough and absorbent.  Plus these are super giant rolls that should last a long time.. Personally, I really love that these are perforated into smaller sections because, while I may never use a single 5.5\" piece, sometimes you need just a little bit more than a full sheet but don't want to waste two entire sheets.  Having the roll broken into smaller pieces is both economical and environmentally responsible.  I should add, however, that some people (like my husband) absolutey hate the \"Select-a-Size\" rolls.  So that's something to consider when you decide whether to buy these or not.. One thing I do want to point out, the advertising for these describes them as \"Quick-Size\" and suggests the towels are divided into pieces smaller than traditional \"Select-a-Size\" sheets but that isn't really the case.  Each perforated section is a little more than 5.5\" - exactly half the size of a normal sized towel.  As far as I can tell, all other  \"Select-a-Size\" towels are 50% the size of a regular sheet.

Bounty does absorb spills quickly and is great for my overall usage. I especially like the pick/quick size which makes them more economical for my family's use. I also notice that one roll of this type of Bounty lasts longer than any other brand of paper towel that I have used..

The o-ring makes seating it firmer as I push the filter in, and SEALS the filter so water must go through it.  Get a thin one, it must fit between the filter and the wall of the insert area.  I put the ring about 3/4\" from the top of the filter, then push it in, and I can feel the o-ring \"rolling\" up the filter as I push and it seats the filter in very firm and tight.  **See pics.

The regular Brita filters did nothing for the taste of my water, & I was just about to toss filters, pitcher, and all when I saw this new filter. I\u2019m actually drinking water that I dont have to choke down for my health.. The Bad: I cannot believe how long it takes to filter 1/2 of the pitcher - an incredible 14 minutes! My regular Brita filters took about 5 minutes. So dont fill this pitcher if you need the water anytime soon. Best to fill it and forget it. Waiting for the water to get through the filter is like waiting for grass to grow!"},

I know about first rinsing a new filter in cold water for 15 seconds. I know that you need to line up the filter with the grooves. I know you then push down hard the filter so it locks in place - so called! AFTER HAVING DONE THIS, the filter still pops up a fraction causing water to leak through the sides of said filter. Now, I am 6'5\", 250 lbs. I lift weights 4 days a week. I am not a weak duckling. Yet, time after time, even after pushing down the filter with all my strength, the filter will not stay tightly secured in place. Why there is no rubber ring for added sealment remains a mystery to me. Why they didn't design this to \"screw\" said filter in place so it is water tight (versus just dropping the filter into the pitcher and pushing down), is a mystery to me. And, even when the filter does happen to seal a little tighter than it normally does, as soon as I move the pitcher about (to pour water for example), the filter will pop up again. The design is flawed, plain and simple. I do not have a bad device per say, it's just that they did not design the filter housing with effectiveness."},

However, within 2-3 weeks, each filter in this two-pack slowed to a CRAWL, barely filtering a single batch of water in 8 hours (!).  I then looked up the official Brita instructions for unclogging these filters and followed those to a \u201ct.\u201d  That didn\u2019t help one bit.  Shortly after trying to fix each of the two filters, black flecks flooded out of them (see first photo).. Now, the box specifically advertises \u201cno black flecks\u201d (see second photo) and \u201clasts 3x longer than standard Brita filters\u201d so to have two of these filters last at most 3 weeks each and then vomit black flecks \u2013 this is either a defective product or false advertising.

When the handle on my beloved snazzy-looking Mavea filtering carafe broke, I only opted for a Brita so I could get this specific supposedly-gets-out-all-the-things filter, and after working in a sad, slow, anemic fashion for a day or two, it started letting approximately one drop thru every 10 minutes or so.. Only in a universe in which I needed a pitcher of water a week would this be acceptable. Please refer to accompanying pic, with full top reservoir, and perfectly still surface of the water accumulated below. Note there is nary a drop falling down to disturb the surface, grr.. Now, since I can't even use it for the reason for which I bought it,  I'm irate every time I have to look at the Brita pitcher, into which I've replaced the normal carbon doesn't-do-much-but-improve-taste (but you know, actually lets water thru!) filter..

At first this filter, which is shorter than the latest filters for full-size pitchers, didn't seem to fit: The filter has only 1 groove and did not fit the cross frame of the pitcher, and didn't even seem to go down all the way to the frame. I almost wrote an angry email, then I tried 1 last time to insert the Longlast filter, TWIST AND TURN AT the same time WHILE PUSHING DOWN and the single groove of the filter did catch 1 part of the cross frame of the pitcher and lock in place. It is tightly sealed, although you can see that 3/4 of the bottom of the filter is not touching the cross frame. Fitration is slow but good and the seal is good. I bought this filter because of the multiple failures in lead contamination testing in schools around the good old city of San Diego. I will not go back to any filter that doesn't take care of lead. I took out 2 stars for the stupid design. Some people in the RnD department at Brita need to go back to school to learn the basics of ergonomics and customer satisfaction.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Best Mattress Cover", "review_body": "I purchased this item to protect my boyfriends mattress because we have several cats and a dog, and accidents happen.. Despite being a rather large/thick, pillow top mattress, this cover has ample room to cover the top of the mattress.  I believe that this could easily fit a mattress that is a few inches thicker than his.  I'm quite thankful to find such wonderful coverage in a mattress cover that doesn't zip around the mattress, but rather one that simple slips over the top.  Due to the amount that stretches under the mattress, even when our fitted sheet rides up on the mattress the cover stays put.. My main point in purchasing this cover was due to it being waterproof.  I was concerned that it may sound crinkly, like some other waterproof covers do, however this cover does not make a single sound.  And the top of it is actually extremely soft.  As of right now, I'm not sure about the extent of it's waterproofness, as we haven't had any spills or accidents since the product has been on our bed, however once that happens I will be sure to update my review.. - - - - UPDATE - - - -. The waterproofness of this mattress cover was finally put to the test during my vacation last week!!  As previously stated, their are several cats in my household and whilst I was on vacation with my family they occupied the house.  Even though I had someone coming in to feed and water them, I did not ask them to clean the litter boxes in the home.  Our Siamese cat is particularly finicky as he gets terribly upset if the litter boxes are not cleaned everyday (I think because one of my female cats doesn't cover her poop and it stinks).  So, he took it upon himself to tinkle on my bed.  I'm so very glad to say that not a single bit of it leaked through the the mattress below, if I could increase my star rating beyond 5 I would do so.  This cover completely protected my mattress from having any of his little anger tinkle on the bed itself.. Also, it was incredible easy to take the cover off to wash and dry.  Washing and drying did nothing to damage the integrity of the cover (which I washed/dried according to the instructions).  Also, it took virtually no time for the cover to dry so I could remake the bed.  This is a wonderful mattress cover."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "It fits well, seems to help dust allergy and I don't even notice it", "review_body": "Five stars based on initial impression after several nights of use along with the Hospitology Sleep Defense System pillow encasement.  I've lived with a chronic, year-round runny nose my whole life, carrying tissues wherever I go.  I finally achieved some sense of normalcy after the advent of non-drowsy antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays, which I use daily.  Fixing my deviated septum was a painful, but huge help in fixing the related congestion issues.  Having not seen an allergy doctor since my childhood decades ago, I went in for an allergy test a couple of weeks ago, and I was surprised to discover that I wasn't allergic to the pollen that plagues the region, but dust.  The doctor recommended mattress and pillow encasements, and he happened to be affiliated with a company.  How convenient.  :)  I did some research, and encasement is a medically-recognized treatment, so it was definitely worth buying some kind of encasement.  My doctor's recommended brand,  Allergy Guardian, was rather pricey, so I decided to shop around.  My wife and I have adjustable TwinXL beds, so the cover choices in that size are rather limited.  SafeRest offers that size, and the reviewers mostly say they don't even notice it's there.  I get warm at night, so that's important.  I was concerned that it doesn't provide total encasement, but it does have elastic all the way around, so it tucks under and keeps everything fairly well enclosed.  It's supposed to be water-resistant as well, so that's a bonus.  I finally ordered the SafeRest based on it coming it being available in TwinXL, having many positive reviews, and being reasonably priced.  I don't notice any plastic feeling under the sheets due to the terry-cloth layer, but it doesn't hold in my body heat enough to cause me any discomfort.  After the first night of use along with the pillow encasement, my sinuses weren't all gunked up like they normally are, so there must be something to this encasement business.  When I got up an around, the dust from the outside world hit me, so this is not a cure-all.  However, I do recommend this mattress protector for dust allergies."},

I suppose I can't imagine a material that could be terribly \"protective\" without being made of something that wouldn't crinkle at least a little bit to the touch.  Makes sense right?  As for comfort, I \"wasn't allowed\" to lay on the new mattress before  this protector went on, so I can't truly compare comfortness before and after installation.  However my memory recalls the mattress being a little softer in the store. The cover isn't capable of being so tight or strong that it could actually suspend my weight above/on top of the coils enoghh to affect comfortness so it is likely just a figment of the imagination."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Fabulous mattress cover.  Works as advertised if you follow manufacturer's washing and drying instructions", "review_body": "This is a great alternative to those really expensive waterproof mattress covers.  It is very thin and easy to work with and I would imagine if you used it on your bed the way it is meant to be used, it would be unobtrusive and therefore comfortable for sleeping. I use mind to keep a leather sofa covered when not in use.  There are wet and muddy dogs living with me and there are cats who occasionally take revenge and seek the most expensive items in the house to pee on.  This is rare, but it does happen.  So this cover goes on the sofa when humans aren't using it (and even when they are). It really is just so thin, which is what I love about it.  It drapes perfectly on the sofa.  The bulkier mattress covers just didn't fit for my purposes very well.. Now you might think that this is a stupid review for a mattress cover given that it has never actually seen a mattress in my house, but I think I'm well qualified to speak to the virtues of this thing because I believe it is much more sorely tested on my sofa than on the average bed.  Nothing has gotten through to the sofa when this cover is in place.  And, it seems pretty tolerant of punishment as well.  One of the dogs is a bit of a frenetic digger and digs herself into the sofa before settling down.  This mattress cover hasn't torn.. So why not four stars?  Simple, I find it a bit annoying that I have to wash and dry it with so little heat lest we lose the waterproof properties of it.  This is a large queen sized item and it take a lot of drying time when only low heat is used.  Do I think this is a good purchase in spite of that?  Absolutely."},

This one is very washer/dryer friendly.. The terry cloth top makes it comfortable and quiet.

I am a little scared to unravel them from the box I put them in for winter break (technically not allowed to hang stuff on the walls) because they do get tangled very easily, but really all lights do amiright? The different modes are a big plus because it makes everything a little more interesting. All in all, they're great lights. You just need a little extension cord."},

I ordered the warm lights and they are very bright and they shine right through the plastic tablecloths I put up, which is exactly the effect that I was hoping for.. Thanks to other reviews, I left them tied until I had them where I wanted them and then undid the ties to let them down.  Since I was just testing them out to see the effect, I folded them back up and put the ties on again before taking them down.  It was a simple procedure to do and will make putting them up again a breeze."},

These were so great and I\u2019m really disappointed they don\u2019t appear to last long.. ORIGINAL REVIEW:. I bought these to pair with sheer curtains behind my bed. I could not be happier with how these look and the dimensions of one strand were perfect for my space. The color is really a warm white which is what I wanted for my bedroom. All of the twinkling options are great too. They were also easy to install with command hooks, just make sure you listen to the reviews and don\u2019t untie all of the strands at once.. The power cord is a little short, but even if it reaches to an outlet it sticks out pretty far (even more so since I added an outlet remote plug). This meant that I couldn\u2019t put my bed flush up against the wall, so I ended up using an extension cord anyway."},

(What are these people doing? Snacking between weigh-ins? Putting the scale on top of a sofa?) Someone else complained about water spots. Hmmmmmmmmm. Something on the floor of a bathroom gets water spots? How shocking! :)  Another awesome feature of this product is its packaging.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Magic scale on my floor, tell me who the ladies adore...", "review_body": "...Etekcity built a scale that says its me ;).. All jokes aside this thing is pretty solid! I want to point out that everything about this scale is GLASS!!! That being said, I'm personally going to keep it in my bedroom away from other solid immovable objects (such as the toilet) to avoid any potential accidents. I'd rather be safe than sorry.. I've read a few 1 star comments about this product and I feel it is my civil duty to point out a couple of things:. 1) you should NOT place this on carpet and then step on it! Any scale won't work correctly on carpet but this is made out of tempered glass. Placing it on carpet will not only give an incorrect reading, but will also put more pressure on the scale itself on any point and will therefore break!. 2) This product is made out of glass. Be aware of it's surroundings and ask yourself if you and your scale are safe around that sketchy looking porcelain fellow next to you.. The feet on the scale will keep it from sliding around; but if it happens to \"bump\" any solid object, no matter how slight it may seem, it will more than likely break. Keep that in mind. 3) I don't have an answer for a dysfunctional LCD screen, but from what I understand, the company is more than happy to send you another one (as long as you follow the guidelines). I've never been excited about a scale in my life and I can't wait to keep track of my personal progress with it. It looks great and to some degree, kind of motivates me to see smaller numbers everytime I step on it."},

I know the scale only reads in every .2 increments, but at how large of a weight I am, those decimals aren't a huge issue.

I wanted something with a digital readout, so I could track even those fractions of pounds.  I am not a small man and was hesitant at first to step on this scale even though the capacity is 400lbs.  I'm not sure why though, because this scale feels like a quality product straight from the box.  The LED is bright and the glass is sturdy.. As far as accuracy is concerned, I probably wouldn't buy this for any scientific experiments or official weigh-ins, but it is fine for home use.  The scale is consistent when you re-weigh yourself, meaning if you step on and off 3 times it always returns the same weight.  This may also be an issue though.  For example, I have weighed myself before and after urinating on multiple occasions. Sometimes the weight dropped and sometimes it didn't change at all.  Logically if you urinate for any significant period of time, the weight should drop. I have also weighed weights that I have to test if it is off at all and the weights were always within .4 lbs, so it is accurate from that aspect.. Even with some of the accuracy questions, this scale is fantastic for the price.  It looks very stylish and durable.  I enjoy looking at the numbers go down every morning when I step on it, which is why I wanted a digital scale in first place.  I'm already down 4 lbs and never had so much fun using scale before."},

Three months isn't a great measurement, since some times we refill it every other day and sometimes every other week.

I threw away the first one because I thought perhaps I had some sediment in my water which perhaps clogged it up (there had recently been construction on my street's water lines). Afterwards I started filling a plain pitcher first to settle out any sediment if there was any issue. Even with that precaution, the filter has still become very slow within a perhaps 30 uses. It is presently running at a rate of about 10 drips in about 7 seconds.. As long as your expectation of the speed of this filter are realistic, it's ok.

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Overall, okay to good.", "review_body": "Arrived as pictured but.... I'll second at least one other purchaser and warn that this version of the filter does have a very annoying flaw; it does indeed frequently slide (up) out of the tube area meant to hold it. Of course, then the unfiltered water is able to stream along the sides and into the lower reservoir, mostly nullifying the purpose. If you simply try to push the filter back in, the water that made it between the filter housing and tube/upper reservoir wall acts like a lubricant, causing the filter to slide out of position even easier, more often.. For a simple, free fix, I cleaned and placed one of those rubber bands sometimes included around bundles of vegetables at the grocery market around the crown of the filter to increase the diameter and function as a seal. The caveat, it's very difficult to position the rubber band because, based on my testing, it must hug the very top edge of the filter for optimum results. Unfortunately, crown is slanted and smooth enough to cause the rubber band to slide down effortlessly. Hopefully, this method lasts throughout the life of each filter. If so, I can deem the hassle acceptable."},

It's been a long while since I have owned and used a Brita filter (or any filter for that matter) so this Advanced filter is something new.  From reading the description it seemed like it was a revolution in the old soaking of a new replacement filter and all that jazz.  But in reality there really isn't much of a difference between the old replacement filters and the Advanced ones in my opinion.  The \"advanced\" filters only mean that you don't have to soak them for (I can't remember the exact time) about 30-45 minutes.  I also can't remember off the top of my head the exact price difference between the old filters and the Advanced but there is a price increase for the Advanced.  If the difference is significant (say, more than a few dollars) I'd say save your money and just buy the non-Advanced ones.  With the Advanced filters you still have to run it for a few minutes under the faucet and you still have to throw out (or as Brita suggests: use it to water plants) the water from the first two or three filterings.  So really does that make it \"Advanced\"?"},

These filters are an update to the old design. They filter water really well and are super easy to use. They are advertised to fit all Brita pitchers. Although I cannot comment on this as I now have a new style pitcher. They fit right in and stay put until they need replacement. They\u2019re rated up to 40 gallons, but that is relative to where you live and that water you have. I usually replace mine every three months with two people using the water pitcher. It\u2019s recommended that the filter is rinsed under running cool water for 15 seconds before installing it in the pitcher. I then discard the first two filtered batches before using it. I\u2019d recommend rinsing the pitcher and wiping it on the inside during the filter replacement since microscopic sediment settles overtime.. I got the 3-pack here through Amazon and it usually averages around five bucks per filter unless there\u2019s a sale or a coupon available. I would recommend buying these directly through Amazon as some third-party sellers do sell fakes. Trust me, I\u2019ve run into this with these filters and shaving razors. Generally if these are purchased through a trusted seller or a brick and mortar store, then it\u2019s the real thing.. I\u2019m very happy with these filters.

Well, I don't know if these are knockoffs, or if Brita just went ridiculously cheap on their low end filters. Because these are not filtering a damn thing. The water flows through them like it isn't even there. It is as if the filter is just a colander without and filtering material to slow it down even more.  Of course, I opened one, so I can't return it. But these are the last Brita filters I will ever purchase. Back to store brand knocks offs. Half the price AND they actually work."},

I washed and dried it according to their instructions, cold to hot wash settings depending on your needs, and, dry on low with other towels or sheets.  I suppose this would insure that you do not damage the plastic waterproofing.  Totally reasonable.  I purchased a different brand of mattress pillow top pad, for my old mattress, earlier, where all the value was in the pillow top itself.  I say this because the elastic around the Stearns and Foster pad that surrounds the sides of the mattress ripped immediately as I put it on.  Terribly thin and delicate.  I was so impressed and delighted with the sides on this SafeRest protector because it is so well manufactured and of high quality throughout.

However much to my surprise the mess did not penetrate the cover and my mattress was unharmed. The only reason i won't give it 5 stars is because I was unable to fully get the stain out of the cover.

In the past, if this sort of thing happened, I've had to remove the sheets and a huge, bulky mattress protector -- which took up all the space in the washer/dryer (so I had to wash/dry it separately from the dirty sheets) and it took forever to dry (plus it was rather difficult to remove and put back on).  But with this protector, I easily stripped it and the sheets off and could easily fit the sheets and protector together in the wash.  Underneath, the mattress was as dry and clean as new.

To my surprise, he was right, the scale was off. However not in the direction I had hoped. My old scale actually showed your weight 6lbs lighter than you actually were. This scale is accurate.... too accurate. Now I know I weigh 6 lbs more than I thought. I was disappointed. Not in the scale, but in myself.

Furthermore, given their capacity, I can use mine about two months before replacing them--and I use them even for clearing my cooking water (who wants dull-tasting sauces?).. Once I gave my coffee maker a through cleaning, I began to exclusively use the filtered water in my morning coffee, which tastes richer, livelier and smoother.

However, I purchased these on February 14, 2018 (happy Valentine\u2019s Day to me...) and on March 4, 2018, it takes nearly an hour to filter the volume of water a standard Brita pitcher holds. One. Drip. At. A. Time. See the video attached. That\u2019s my reason for 3 stars. I did not expect the filters to take THAT long. You have to be really cognizant of how much water you have given how long it\u2019ll take to filter. Not great for cooking or washing vegetables (you\u2019ll run out of clean water too fast and it takes too long to filter)."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Do not buy unless you like waiting 3 hours after each refill!", "review_body": "I'm only giving this product 2 stars and not 1 since it does filter the water... eventually. I have had this filter for a month now and it is a real pain every time I need to refill the pitcher. I thought buying this filter rather than 3 at a time would save packaging and also not have to think about replacing a filter every month or so. If I had known that this filter would take about 3 hours to filter water every time I filled the pitcher, I would have kept ordering the regular filters. I understand that since this is a longer lasting filter, that the filter will take longer to purify the tap water. But waiting 3 hours each fill up is beyond excessive. It's gotten to the point that I can't possibly keep this for another 2-4 months until I need to replace it. It is aggravating to say the least. Especially since it's summer and we drink a lot more water this time of year. We might pass out from dehydration before the pitcher fills with cleaned water!. I have taken the steps that other's have mentioned: taking out the filter and hitting it a bit to get air bubbles out (doesn't help), re-soaking & running the filter under cold water for 15 seconds (doesn't help) and I've made sure that the filter has been properly inserted and created a seal.. Bottom line, this is a filter for water and it does just that. But a 3 hour water fill up is unacceptable. I have been using Brita filters for at least 15 years now and have never had a problem like this one. I will be replacing this filter with the regular filters from now on. I just wish I could get my money back for such a crummy product."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Push Harder", "review_body": "I bought the 3-pack filters elsewhere. However, I found that the new filter style leaked some water down the side of the filter after the install, instead of going through the inside element. After looking at it, I pushed down harder on the replacement filter to seat it correctly. The upper lip of the replacement filter is now just below the lower lip of the housing. That fixed the problem. Now all water exits through the four holes in the filter bottom. The older filters did not require as much elbow grease. Hope this helps those complaining about leaking filters or tap-tasting filtered water. We've enjoyed our Brita for years and I hope it continues to last."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Better tasting water", "review_body": "Brita is my favorite brand of water filter! I generally change my filter every 2 months (without letting the filter dry out) and it has made my tap water taste so much better. This 3 pack is the perfect amount for me and having back up filters available is ideal for busy schedules since this ordering a new filter slips my mind now and then. In the correct type of pitcher, these filters will fit snugly, creating a water tight seal that will allow efficient filtering. The price for 3 filters is pretty reasonable and they are worth the money to have drinkable water at home. One thing to note is that on this item's sales page it says that you do not need to soak the filter prior to use. However, the instructions that come with the package says that you should soak the filter before use! This is not that much of a hassle and it helps to get rid of any black flecks that may come out. Overall, I would highly recommend this product and other Brita brand products."},

The only issue I've had is that occasionally one will pop loose if the water volume in the post-filter area gets past about 3/4 full. This usually happens after the filter has been in use a while, so I am not sure of the cause (the container never gets moved, so it isn't being bumped loose).  Not a big deal, by any means, but it is annoying.  Also, with the most recent lot of filters we bought, I've noticed that there is a definite \"bleach-y\" odor to the water if it sits in the reservoir for more than about 48 hours.  I would say it is simply the city flushing the water system (we filter our tap water), but the odor isn't present when I draw water from the faucet.  It doesn't seem to affect the taste, but it isn't very appealing, either.  Since we use this water primarily for the coffee pot and making iced tea, it hasn't really been a big deal."},

It said 2 = 5, the same as the other ones did, and it also showed the select-a-size logo on the package. The only difference that I noticed is that it said \"Family Size\" and \"Quick Size\". I have been using the huge select-a-size rolls for years and really loved them. They were perfect for my needs. This \"new\" version has made the sheets too narrow. WHY take something that was perfect and mess with it???. This new version makes me think of that old saying, \"If it ain't broken, don't fix it\"!! I can't imagine that they could think that the average customer wouldn't notice the difference. Do they take us for fools? First they did that with toilet paper, making the sheets smaller and too narrow. Most of the companies did that, one after the other, thinking that we would have no choice but to buy it anyway. Thankfully, Costco still offers regular sized rolls of that. I hope that all of the other companies don't soon follow in the footsteps of Bounty and change the size of their paper towels also. Greed and profit seem to always win out over quality and convenience nowadays.. Too bad that I purchased the 12 rolls of this, thinking that I was getting a good deal. Perhaps they think that if the sheets are very narrow, you will be forced to use two sheets instead of one for many tasks and use it up more quickly that way. I find it very deceitful to use the same terms, 2 = 5 and select-a-size, to describe a smaller quantity of an item and to trick people into perhaps not noticing that they are getting less of it and paying more. When I use up these 12 rolls, I will once again search for the original huge rolls. If I can't find them, then I will most likely have to change brands."},

As suggested on the packaging, those two roles have about as many sheets of paper towels as would be in 5 individual rolls of most other products, so a 2 pack bundle for me would last a good while.  On the bigger bundles I have a minor issue in terms of storing the rolls, though there is a bit of an advantage at most places in terms of a discount for buying in bulk.. While I wish these were less spendy, again, I find them worth the extra cost and spend on them as needed.  5 solid stars for durable paper towels that tear off in convenient sizes.  They do what they are supposed to in terms of absorbing liquids or holding up for use when scrubbing and cleaning.  What else would you want from your paper towels?"},

Tip: putting the scale on a hard surface isn't enough - make sure the surface is level, and that all four feet are resting solidly on said surface. Otherwise, you won't get an accurate reading. And keep the glass cleaner/paper towels handy - this scale will show smudges and water marks quickly. Not a knock on it, just an observation.. Minor nitpick - the display (and backlight) take way too long to turn off after you step off the scale. Wastes battery life unnecessarily, in my opinion. Other than that, I'm happy."},

I hope the company has taken steps to correct this issue and that they honor the warranty even if something like it shattering suddenly occurs.

When I recieved the towels I was suprised at the quality.  They are very nice towels and are very soft.  I used these to dry my car and they worked very well.  They can soak up a good amount of water and are very durable.  I have also used these to clean my cherry kitchen cabinets.  They are very soft so they wont damage the wood.  They were perfect for cleaning up grease splatter that managed to get on the cabinets.  They are also perfect for dusting around the house.  My wife has been grabbing these to dust just about everythign because they are so soft that they wont damage anything.  One neat use that I have found for them is washing my dog.  I dont want to use an expensive bath towel to wash my dog so I grab 2-3 of these and they work perfect!  They are good for a scrubbing and great for drying the dog off.  They absorb well and any odor can be washed right off in the washing machine.. Washing:. I have washed these multiple times and they have not gone down in quality at all.  They stand up to the washing machine very well.  I just throw them in warm and tumble dry low.  No loose threads or thinning of the towels that I can see.  I have to say I was very suprised that they held up so well for this price.  They dont stain easily either.  Of course they CAN be stained, but for most jobs they stains come right out.. Final Thoughts:. If you have ever bought any \"Amazon Basics\" products you will know that they put out very high quality products at very reasonable prices.  The price of these towels is so low that they are basically disposable if you want, but the quality is so high that you will find yourself grabbing them for all kinds of jobs."},

I washed them with detergent that has the fabric softener built-in, and that was a mistake -- they are not as absorbent now and lost their \"grabbiness.\"  They work much better if you wash them alone (they grab lint from other towels and clothing) and do not use fabric softener on them.  We use these for cleaning reading glasses, wet and dry dusting, cleaning windows, drying dishes, drying the car.  They'll keep working great if you clean them properly after use."},

I purchased 3 Longlast filters and a Brita 10 cup pitcher.  My usage is about 1 quart per day.  I used the standard filter that came with my pitcher first and it lasted about 4 months before I decided to change it and installed one of the Longlast filters.  In less than a month it was filtering so slowly that it was barely usable, i.e. several hours to filter a quart of water, and then it got even slower over the next week or so until I was forced to change it.  The next two Longlast filters were just as bad.. I found some information on the Brita web site suggesting the Longlast filters could get air bubbles trapped inside and a procedure to re-soak and squeeze the filter cartridge to release the trapped air.  This procedure did not make any difference.  There were also a lot of negative user reviews of Longlast filters on the site from other users.. In my experience, the Longlast model lasts about ONE-THIRD as long as the standard filters, not 3 times as long as advertised.  Stick with the standard filters!"},

Now, at 2 months, it barely filters at all. Its slower than a drip. I fill it at night and let it go all night. Not practical, or useful. Unless the filters can be cleaned or cleared, it is too slow to get clean water. My water isn't hard or that dirty, so I was expecting these filters to last and be efficient. Kind of a waste of $$ and frustrating."},

The new shape makes them easier to grasp and install. You also no longer need to soak the filters prior to use, which I find more convenient. The newer design seems to filter the water much quicker which is great for my family that can go through a pitcher very rapidly. I have also noticed that there aren't any of those unsightly black \"floaters\" in my water anymore.. As for the functionality, these filters make my tap water taste much better and remove many of the impurities and toxins. Given the amount of water you can filter, this is not only a much more cost effective solution to bottled water but also more environmentally friendly one.. Overall, these are great filters at a reasonable price! I will be purchasing more in the near future."},

If I could have, I would have given NO STARS.  It was slow to begin with and only got slower and slower.  We go through about 4 fills per day(about 2 gallons) in our house(with the regular filters).  This filter was always slower and would take over an hour to drain one time, even when it was new.  But after a month or two, it began to take multiple hours to drain once. Now, I realized that I can fill it at night and then in the morning, it's drained less than half way."},

Also, there are so far a lot less black flecks in the top of the Brita canister and the water tastes great. Overall, to save a $1.50-2 (ish) dollars, the off-brand filters are just not worth it, my guess is they do not contain as much activated charcoal, I base this on my vast knowledge of water filter technology and science background that comes with being a communications major, so basically, nothing, but the filter is great."},

They stay on the bed now, because as I've always been told as a quilter, 'cotton holds hands'  and will stay affixed to each other and not slide apart and off the bed.  Has improved sleep at least 95% if not more.. This is an excellent product that I would recommend to anyone with or without a hospital bed.

It must have item if your child is while in potty training or just about finishing it.  It slightly feel warmer maybe because of this water proof processing, it's not a matter in winter but maybe feel hotter in summer in that case if you put another cover or sheets on, it may reduce the feeling of heat.  Anyway, you can't replace mattress such easily, better use it to protect it from bed-wetting.. It is stretched quite well but water proof process(back side) may be broken before the clothes part is fully stretched, when I pull this mattress cover, I feel like that.  (top part and side part are different and side part are not water proof, have children sleep in center as much as possible). Washing is ok doing normal way but after spin dry, be careful pulling it out from the wash machine because water still remaining a lot in this mattress cover, pulling it up may stretch it too much and water proof process may be broken. just turn inside-out to try draining water and spin again and repeat it if necessary. (I usually do regular spin dry twice). When I dry it in drier, I usually use less heat for short time just to rise temp in drier drum and turn to fluff air and repeating it for a half day..... maybe I am doing too much careful though.... It require proper care, it's different from 100% clothes mattress cover but with such proper care, washing will not be a problem and again, it saves your mattress for sure."},

That will vary, as some generic stuff is completely useless. However, we've found that the price for buying in bulk and the high quality of the Bounty Paper Towels may be worth jumping over to name brand.. You've got smaller sized sheets, which have enough absorption as a normal sized sheet. Which means using less paper towels, buying less, and potentially saving money. Although in some cases, we found the need to use two, versus one larger sheet. So it really depends on your uses. For us, we'll need to crunch some more numbers at the time these are on sale.. Try out a single roll, compare to your current brand. See what makes sense as savings can add up over time. I like these and consider them recommended."},

The scale is very responsive and displays a reading immediately, though of course you should wait a few seconds for it to stabilize and show a final weight. The backlight is a huge bonus, as my shadow covers the display and would make it hard to see the readings without it. The design is also very sleek and allows it to be placed in just about any bathroom without clashing with the current decor. Auto on/off is also helpful. True, it does not display body fat percentage, but measuring that through a scale is not very accurate anyhow, and for this price, it already offers plenty. I would certainly buy again, although I doubt that I will need to."},

And the previous scale is off by a percentage of weight so he was ticked off that I too did not actually weigh 5-7 lbs more than I believed. ( I did wonder why my doctor's office weight was always more, even accounting for clothing.  Does anyone else want to strip down b4 they weigh at the doctor's office? I would except them moved the scale to the hallway.)  Any hoo back to the review.  Great scale.  Consistent numbers... like I weight myself 3 times in a row & its the same number.

The water source is from a well; one high in dissolved solids; so much so that all water-related appliances are stained or coated with a heavy film of rust.  When we initially ran the water to flush the lines, we noticed a strong smell of rotten eggs emanating from the sink in the bathroom.  After checking the inline filter, I decided to change from a paper filter the landlord provides to a charcoal-impregnated commercial filter we pay for.  I believe this to be in my family\u2019s best interest.  This helped remove most of the water issues.  We then filter all drinking water coming from our sink (using our Brita Pitcher) so, our water is double-filtered.  We bought the filters in MARCH of this year.  After using up our supply of regular Brita filters, we changed over to the Brita \u201cBlue\u201d filters hoping to make our drinking water safer yet, taste better; while removing all hint of iron and the smell of Sulphur.  The first one made it to May 24th as it became very slow to filter - not NEARLY the six months advertised.  However, I attribute this to the high sediment in the water - but the main filter should get 99% of that out!  Today, June 19th, it now takes the second filter TWO HOURS to filter ONE filling of the top of the Pitcher; and it takes two fillings to fill the pitcher!  Our family of four goes through plenty of drinking/cooking water every day.  This cannot go on.  I believe we will be looking for another brand filter as the regular Brita filters do not do the job well enough; while the blue filters keep more contaminants out, they do not seem to last very long.  NOT worth the money!"},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Stick with the regular filters, not the long last...it takes too long!", "review_body": "It takes entirely too long to filter the water as compared to the regular filter. I have to schedule fillings so that it doesn't annoy me: right before I leave for work, or right before I go to bed. If you are making a large amount of coffee and pouring a couple glasses of drinking water for guests...you're out. I'd rather stick with the regular filters and change them out more often because the filtering tastes the same and it doesn't take as long."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Lasts long because it takes forever to filter", "review_body": "Summary:. - Don't buy these, especially if the water with which you fill your pitcher has a lot of air bubbles in it. - If your water is already pretty clean and you just want to improve on taste, stick to the standard filters. Pros:. - Lead removal. - No more carbon dust. - Same fit as the standard filters. Cons:. - Prone to air locking (clogging up due to trapped air). At 19ppm, measured using a\u00a0. , I'm fortunate enough to have pretty clean water straight out of the tap, but I've always used a water filter to improve the taste. I decided to give these a try because of the added perks of lead removal and extended lifespan. With the exception of being blue, the filters looked and installed just like the standard Brita filters. They no longer have the issue of carbon dust and particles leaking out of them and you don't need to pre-soak them before installing.. At first use, I could see that the Longlasts filtered water slower than the standard filters, but not so slow that it was a concern. Over the course of a month, however, the filter would take longer to filter with each fill. At its worst, after an hour, it still wasn't done filtering. After three months of planning my schedule around how quickly my pitcher would filter water, I tossed the filter and installed the second of the two-pack. I thought that maybe the first filter was a fluke, but after a month, the second filter also stopped filtering water.. After some research, I read about how gravity-based water filters can suffer from \"air locking,\" where small air bubbles can get trapped and essentially clog the filter. I suspect whatever Brita did to the Longlast versions of these filters increased the potential for air locking. I tried some of the suggestions that Brita gave to other customers experiencing the same issues, such as tapping the pitcher to shake out some of the air, and while it helped, it never resolved the issue.. After tossing out the last one, I went back to the\u00a0. . Ultimately, I went through the two Longlast filters in four months, which is a far cry from the 12 month promise."},

I literally have ur filtering all day long and try to save as much water as possible in a pitcher. It takes hours for a mere 16oz to filter.

The negative reviews are TRUE.  I installed the first filter on July 18, 2018 and could not believe how long it took to empty the reservoir.  Then, on August 1, 2018 it STOPPED WORKING.  This is 2 weeks for a filter that is advertised as being good for 6 months.  Also, the taste of the filtered water is not as good as I expected it to be.  Bottled water is better.  After being a long time Britta user I am looking for a new filter system.  With all the bad reviews it seems like either Britta or Amazon no longer care about their product or their customers.  Maybe Mr. Bezos is more concerned with his space efforts than his company.. September 1, 2018. FOLLOW UP REVIEW. Following my critical review I was contacted by Britta and given a telphone number and a reference number.. I called the number and was given the option of a refund or receive a replacement 2 pack of Longlast filters.  Since I have had a long and satisfactory relationship with Britta I chose the replacement option.  BIG MISTAKE!! The replacement filters were as defective as those I received originally.  The first filter was installed on August 17, 2018.  By August 30 it was taking 6 to 8 hours for the reservoir to empty through the filter.  AND there is now a blotchy, streaky substance on the interior of the white reservoir.. When I initially called Britta I was told that about 10% of their filters from an un-named manufacturer were defective.  What are the odds that I would get the defective ones a second time?.

As far as the product goes it appears to be of genuine fine quality( I don't fear it tearing or being damaged during washings) and thoughtful in design in regards to protection. The uppermost layer does genuinely feel like terry cloth, which isn't the ideal texture to sleep on for myself yet it is quite breathable. Its multiple layers assure me that it will be protective and additionally do not retain heat as strongly as I had originally thought it would.

I could hardly believe how nice my first night's sleep was! I though I would miss the padding from the other pads, but it was a delight to just have a smooth comfortable surface to lay down on. A couple of nights ago I had a nosebleed in the middle of the night without knowing it. In the wee hours of the morning there was a large spot where the blood had settled. I sprayed it with water, to keep it from drying, and moved over so I wouldn't be on it. My wife washed the sheet and the pad that morning.

I like the cover, I will hopefully never have to test the waterproofness of the cover.. Construction appears above average, with a nice \"terry cloth\" surface. Had a pretty cheap one before that was tearing at the top and the edges, so this seems to be a lot better.. Bought this with our new Casper mattress to protect it and it fits well.. Cons:. A bit expensive for a cover, but seems to be worth the cost to protect a new mattress.. Middle of The Road:. Though I would overall agree with other reviews that it is not \"noisy\" per say, but if you remove your pillow and move around right on the mattress you can hear the waterproof layer shuffling a bit.

Luckily the main setting is something I\u2019m happy with, but I\u2019m also not tall enough to reach the control box, so I\u2019d need a step stool in order to change the setting, which is a bit inconvenient.

Sometimes, like a standard iron, steamers can spit water out unevenly, but that hasn't happened with this one.. If you're looking for a compact steamer, I think you'll be very happy with the size of this one. The price is very fair and prime shipping makes it an easy choice if you need one quickly.

Hospitals have wheelchair and bed scales, but will not allow us to weigh her if she is not admitted.  At her caregiver's suggestion, I purchased two of the scales.  BTW, he is a big, strong fellow.  With one foot firmly planted in the center of each scale, he lifted my mother and held her in his arms while I recorded their combined weights on each scale.

We both get wildly inconsistent results when we try to use it. Just this morning, I weighed myself four times and got four different weights: 158.1, 165.2, 170.0, and 162.0 (in order of when I stepped on the scale). That's a 12 pound range. He has gotten similarly widely ranged results. To be clear, we placed our scale on a tile, bathroom floor and we have not moved it since putting it in the bathroom. Also, he and I have both calibrated the scale by stepping on it, stepping off it, letting it tare to 0.0, then stepping on it again. This is not a case of user error.. This is very frustrating if you are tracking your pounds and want consistent results. It's only really good for making your bathroom look like you care about health enough to own a scale. If you want to know your weight within 12 pounds, this thing will give you some utility, but if you want anything more consistent, invest a few more dollars and get a better scale. I'm returning this thing ASAP."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great for weighing everything.", "review_body": "I had a scale before I decided to purchase this one, it constantly gave me an error message whenever I decided to try to weigh myself no matter how or where I would place the scale. I decided I would no longer have to deal with that scale with so many options on the market, and did some searching around amazon for a decent replacement.. After checking around to see what was decently rated scale, my decision was finally made. This was the one to order. Thanks to prime, i received it in the two days with absolutely no hiccups. I opened the box and took the package out. Nice and compact, no packaging was wasted with this scale. Took it out and tossed out my old scale. Placed it on the nice flat surface of the bathroom as I didn't want to get a fluctuating value coming from using it on a carpeted area. The readout on the display was correct.. Decided to test it out more, moved it around the bathroom just to make sure it would have the same readout. Thankfully it did so I could just a proper place to put the scale and keep it there to properly and accurately keep track of my weight.. As an overweight man, I was mildly afraid that stepping on the tempered glass surface would cause some kind of damage. I had never done so before in my life. Thankfully nothing happened, and the scale itself felt incredibly sturdy.. After giving it a go for weeks, I decided to try to weigh my large dog on it by comparing the weight readout on my own to the readout while carrying my dog. It worked very well for this too. So if you ever wonder what something may weigh and it's too wide or weirdly shaped you can go ahead and do a comparison to get a very accurate number.. I'd recommend this scale over many others i've tried. The scale hasn't failed me in the seven months i've had it, and i'll be sure to report any issues with it promptly."},

Looks great, has a backlit display, and provides quick/accurate readings. I don't need a scale with any fancy features, just one that I don't have to hide when company comes over, and I know will provide a reasonably accurate reading.. The only negatives I would have for this scale is that the glass has to be wiped down every couple days because it shows smudges and dirt really easily. You also need to make sure it's on a flat surface or you will get really weird reaction readings, but that's probably typical for any scale. Either way, I'm satisfied with my purchase."},

Cons:. - The only issue I have with this scale thus far is that it seems to round the weight a little bit. I seem to always be XXX.8 even though if you watch the numbers it will start out with a .4 or .6 and then finalize as .8. I have only had the scale for about 3 weeks so I will keep checking on this, but I found it odd that it would not read exact."},

However, there appears to be a couple of layers of material, including one that I thought might be impervious to liquids. My fear that it would be noisy and crinkly was laid to rest after I put it on the mattress and sat down. Still not convinced I laid on it and heard nothing. I didn't tell my wife that I'd put this protector on and she was completely unaware. Excellent product at an excellent price. I'd buy again..."},

It is not wise to attempt a brief play session on the bed first...lol) Although I was quite annoyed at having to strip the bed of its comforter, fitted sheet, and allergy bag, I was so grateful that the 4th layer, this mattress protector, although quite soaked with puppy urine, did not allow a single drop of liquid to pass through and onto my mattress. I can attest that this mattress protector washes up well. (Be sure to dry on low heat, so as not to damage the waterproof material.) I am also tickled at how easily it goes onto and fits my extra thick mattress--the elastic sides reach far beneath our Queen-sized bed, so it stays securely in place. After 3.5 years of use, I noticed it's time for a replacement. The waterproof material on the underside is starting to crack, and my stain release spray soaked right through.

I love the different lighting options but I chose to leave them on constantly for a more relaxing light. I was surprised at first because they are not like the battery-operated fairy lights I have seen before but are a little bigger and heavier LED bulbs. As others have said: do not indo all of the ties until you have the main top piece hung.. In my case I bought a Mainstays Cafe Window Curtain Rod 28\"-48\" in Bronze, Mainstays Marjorie Sheer Voile Curtain Panel in Artic White Color,  and Home Details Curtain Rings (clips) in Bronze from the local big box store. I had already hung the curtain and then easily attached the lights with the curtain ring clips. I have mine plugged into a plug-in timer so they will automatically turn on and off.  They add a nice romantic ambiance to the room and allow is to watch TV with just a little back light. I highly recommend."},

The only reason I didn't give this a full 5 stars is because the lights get tangled so easily, it was a real pain for me to get them up. But once I got them up they looked amazing!.

My husbands came out about 20 pounds too light (he happened to go to the doctor this afternoon so we know his actually weight). Then we weighed my kids and it said my five year old weighed more than my eight year old (she is clearly much smaller) and it took forever to even have the numbers settle on a weight. It\u2019s on a hard, flat bathroom floor. There\u2019s no reason for this and it\u2019s not worth sending back refunds. I spent $20 on garbage apparently."},

I bought this scale so I could track my weight loss, and it definitely does the trick. It's very consistent. The only caveat is that you want to make sure your weight is centered - sometimes when I hold my hands slightly away from my body, that affects the reading. However, I think that is a plus, that it is that sensitive.. Physically, the product is sturdy and discreet with a sleek design. It's low enough that I can store it underneath my bathroom sink/vanity, and I can also easily pull it out to weigh myself every morning. There's a little bit of grip on the bottoms of the feet, but it's just enough. It doesn't interfere much with pulling it out, but my scale always feels steady and firmly placed when I step on it.. Good product, would purchase again."},

No more rocking back and forth while the numbers go up and down.  I'm assuming it is settling in on an average weight.

I can SOMETIMES get it to work by stepping one foot on first and then put the rest of the weight on. But even that normally takes 3-4 chances.

Immediately I stepped on it and was hoping for a lower number, go figure, so was my wife. We were both disappointed with the numbers we saw after a winter of laziness and over-eating, so just to be sure, I grabbed some rarely used weights and decided to test the accuracy of the scale.. First, a 10 lb weight......reading was 10.0 lbs. After a few seconds, it zeroed out...... Second, I added a 5 lb weight.....reading was 5.0 lbs. After a few seconds, it zeroed out...... Third, I added another 5 lb weight......reading was 5.0 lbs. After a few seconds, it zeroed out...... When I removed all (3) weights totalling 20 lbs.......it showed a stored reading of 20.0 lbs. EXACT ACCURACY, to the 10th of a pound!!!. I repeated the same test, and got the exact same result.. Damn......time to get back to hiking now that it's warming up. lol. Here's a tip!. Go to your orders on Amazon, and get the order number. Go to the Etekcity website and sign up, go to your email inbox and confirm the account.. On their website, go to the warranty section, and enter the order number. Then your product will be warrantied for 1 year (read the details, of course). You have just 7 days to do it."},

In order to prevent this, I wound several turns of Teflon tape around the rim of the filter. This prevents introducing unfiltered water into the lower reservoir."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Okay", "review_body": "These filters are nice, I guess. Don't have the tool advertised to measure the amount of minerals left in my water but based on taste, my water tastes fine. One of the two filters noticeably filtered slower than the other. Perhaps the way things were packed internally were different. Because of this annoyance, I removed a star. Other than that, they came individually wrapped and sanitized. Will consider reordering this item(s)."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Buy Regular Water Filters Instead", "review_body": "Initially, I thought this would save money from having to change water filters as often but these simply don't filter very well.. I still can taste the chlorine in the water after it has filtered.. Plus, the first water filter clogged up right away (I thought maybe it was defective) so we tried the second one in the pack and it flows better so far, but still not as good at filtering the water as regular water filters."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Brita does reduce TDS.", "review_body": "I'm basically reviewing the Brita system.  I've tried several of the off brand filters to try and save some money, but the only filters that I have come across that reduce TDS are the Brita brand.  Of course, there is Zero Water which is not an economical solution IMO and also reportedly has reported issues with turning the water acidic before the filter is \"spent\" and is still removing solids.  At any rate, there must be a DI resin in the Brita filters that the generics that I have tried do not have.  And this is the thing that I think is unrealized ... the Brita system does reduce total dissolved solids.  It is not just a particulate and carbon \"taste\" filter.  TDS out of our tap is around 150.  First pass from a new Brita cuts it in half.  Second pass cuts it by about 60% more.  I mix Brita filtered water, half and half, with distilled and need to get the Brita filtered water TDS down into the 30's so that, when mixed with distilled water (0 TDS), the mix is below 20 TDS.  I drink almost nothing but water and my water has to have virtually no taste at all.  Below 20 TDS, the water is taste free to my palate.  My wife drinks water with a little of the flavor that comes in the small squeeze bottles, and she drinks tea.  One pass through the Brita is fine with her.  Between the two of us, we get about 10-14 days from a Brita filter.  No where near 200 gallons, or whatever Brita claims.  But again, I have some strange requirements.  At any rate, 10-14 days is about the time where it takes 4 passes through the filter to be able to get the TDS down low enough for my palate (20 TDS or less, mixed with 1/2 distilled) and it becomes too much of a chore.  Probably not a bad thing to change the filter more often as the pitcher gets cleaned frequently.  The bottom line is that we really aren't saving much money using the Brita system over buying bottled water.  Maybe a few bucks because we don't need to buy spring water for my wife so it's convenient to only have to lug 3 gallon bottles of distilled from the grocery store each week for my finicky palate and no spring water since my wife is good with the Brita.  We haven't tried the PUR or any other system.  And we wont try the Zero Water because of the reported issues with low PH acidic water (sour) and the cost of the filters.  All in all, the Brita system works pretty well for us and the filters don't cost an arm and a leg.  We've been using the Brita for 3 or 4 years now.  There are often good deals here on Amazon for 5 or 6 packs of the filters too.  Not perfect, but a pretty good system for us."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "These worked fine - for about a month", "review_body": "These worked fine - for about a month.  Then they started filtering so so slowly, it would take hours to fill the pitcher.  I went through four of these, thinking each time that the last one was a lemon and surely this one would last the advertised 6 months - but nope.  I mean, maybe they're still technically working at 6 months, but I shouldn't have to wait half a day for a single pitcher of filtered water.  I would suspect that this is due to our very hard water, but I didn't have this problem with the regular filters - they would slow over time too, but not that much that quickly."},

I started to use the blue last-long filter when I replaced one of my white filter early in July 2018. The first blue filter only works for two weeks then the water stop dripping even if I left it overnight. After taking out to wash/flush/shake/tap, it was still not working. I first thought it was my fault at some point. So, I changed to the second blue filter on prime day. It worked fine in the first week, water dripping fast enough. Today is exactly two weeks after prime day. The water almost stopped dripping through my second blue filter again.. How I use the blue filter?. I first filtered New York City tap water through the white filter in one Brita Metro pitcher. Then I poured the pre-filtered water into the next pitcher installed with a blue \"Longlast\" filter. I filtered 3 to 4 Brita Metro reservoir-size of water through blue Longlast filter per day.. It doesn't even survive 1 month. Brita claims it lasts 6 month? maybe, if you plan to filter laboratory quality ultra pure water at home."},

We dealt with this by storing our filtered water in bottles. However, when we had high demand (like parties) it was was extremely frustrating to have to wait. There would be evenings I would fill the pitcher, then discover that it had not finished filtering in the morning..

After using my full size Zero water pitcher once, it split so I took it back to Walmart where I had bought it, and exchanged it for the smaller pitcher which was a slightly thicker gauged plastic. Amazon has very competitive prices for the Zero water filters!"},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "One Star", "review_body": "Worked great for all of 3 days, then would not pass a drop of water.. UPDATE:  I contacted Brita, who suggested the following:. 1. Tap the pitcher while there is water in the reservoir to dislodge any trapped air that may be in the filter.  Any bubbles that float up from the filter while tapping are an indication that this solution is working and that water flow will improve.. 2. Remove filter, tap it firmly on a solid surface and/or shake it for a few seconds, then re-insert.. 3. Re-rinse the filter or soak filter fully submerged for 15 minutes.  The new advanced filters do not need soaking; however, soaking may coincidentally improve the slow flow issue.. None of the above made any difference, so we tossed the filter and tried the 2nd one from the pack - a few days later, it stopped working too.  Brita's response was offer us coupons for future purchases.  Thanks, Brita, but I do not need more defective filters.. UPDATE:  Replaced the Brita with an Aquagear, and very happy with it because it actually works.. UPDATE 2:  Aquagear had same problems.  I give up, none of these advanced filters seem to actually work reliably."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "A Really Good Buy!", "review_body": "Use these filters in the Brita pitcher and find they eliminate totally the chlorine smell and taste.  Each filter lasts us at least two months and we drink a lot of water.  They are much cheaper than the filters sold in our local supermarket, which did not always have the filters we wanted.  So, six filters lasts about a year and eliminates multiple trips to the store.  A really good buy!"},

We live in Southern California where it\u2019s been 80-100 degrees pretty much everyday, and yet the other night we went to plug them in, the turned on, then immediately off, and they wouldn\u2019t turn back on no matter what. We even checked them out the next day to see if we missed something, and we couldn\u2019t figure out why they\u2019d only last for a month!!! SUPER frustrating to waste money on something that you don\u2019t even get your money\u2019s worth from. Maybe they shouldn\u2019t be advertised as indoor/outdoor lights, maybe they\u2019re really just indoor lights if you want them to last... that\u2019s why I did so much research to find ones that were ok for outdoors, and clearly these are not them. So becareful if purchasing for anything outdoors... Don\u2019t recommend!. OLD Review prior to 4/23: These are great outdoor decor lights! they come sectioned off with twist ties to keep them untangled and for easy hang up. But if you discover your boyfriend has taken all the twist ties off at once to try to hang them, it won\u2019t be so easy! I recommend you take them to the location you want, and untwist tie them as you are hanging them up. It will workout much more flawlessly! Purchased these lights as a small part of the backyard remodel and glad I did. They are such long light strands that I ended up twisting them back upwards to the top of the fence for each strand and it gives off a lot more light! Its been about 2 weeks now and with a decent amount of rain, over several days, and they are still holding strong! The fact that they have different modes for the lights is also a plus for different events or modes. All the modes are listed on the little power box so it\u2019s easy to refer to. Great value for these. Even during the day you don\u2019t notice them much, they kinda blend in which is great they aren\u2019t an eyesore.

Had this scale for three months, nearest accuracy it will weigh to is .2 of a lb in theory but it doesn't measure that close. Weighed myself tonight, then used the bathroom, was well hydrated so there was a lot, weighed again and it was the exact same.. So like I said it isn't greatest accuracy, but overall it will get you in the ballpark.. Update: according to manufacturers this scale is accurate to nearest .3 of  (.6 lb). They emailed me shortly after my review. I stand by my assessment, good for ballpark area, but .6lb isn't going to show you possibly a week or two of results."},

Once it gets a final reading, it keeps the numbers on-screen for around 10 seconds.. The glass top also feels sturdy. I don't have any hesitation stepping onto it, even at the edges.. The only critique is that the weight it reads can vary a bit depending on how you stand on it. For someone just casually tracking their weight, it's probably not an issue. For anyone trying to measure more accurately, I'd recommend doing 2-4 readings in a row to see what comes up most often.The variance is always less than a pound but it is a bit odd."},

Make sure it is set on hard even floor. The reading is quick and very accurate. There is no button to turn it on, it turns on when you step on it, it reads your weight and the numbers start blinking. Once it stops you can step off of it and that's your accurate weight. After a decently short while it will turn off on its own so you don't have to worry about it. The lighting on it is blue and the scale itself is black and clear in some parts. I would highly recommend this seller and this product."},

A large set in three colors so I can keep my bathroom cleaning cloths separate from my kitchen ones.. While cleaning, these do a great job of absorbing liquid and work well as a scrubber with a little elbow grease.. I usually have one hanging in the kitchen and wash it after 2-3 uses (of wiping down counters, oven, sink, etc). When using to clean the bathroom it gets washed after one cleaning..

I had washed these cloths and intended to use them to remove makeup and my entire face got covered in fur.  It doesn't even seem to be static cling that causes it -- the cloths physically trap hair and fuzz during the washing/drying process.  I guess that's what would make these great dusting rags, except that you'll never get the dust back off of them without manually picking it off.. As an aside... since the time that I purchased these, I've read that microfiber cloths are contributing to a massive amount of plastic fibers polluting the environment.  They are ending up in our oceans and have been identified by some studies to be the most frequent pollutant.  These fibers are even found in microscopic particles everywhere around our homes, which we are inhaling and ingesting.  Something to think about.

I like having a waterproof mattress pad, but I hate other models that a) stink of vynil b) crinkle and c) fall apart when you wash them, or have their waterproof layer shift. This model does none of the above.  It also does NOT add bulk to the bed.  The full elastic makes it easy to get it on and KEEP it on.  Yes, this would also work with a moderate pillowtop mattress.  I don't have a pillowtop but there's enough give in the elastic skirting to probably accommodate up to 2\" or 3\" of pillowtop or a foam topper.. It washes up very nicely also.  I usually send my laundry out (hello NYC) at a dropoff service, and they tend to abuse the heck out of anything you send them, and my last one of these for my fullsize bed stood up to at least 3 years of abuse at the laundromat (and was in perfect shape when I got rid of it; my old one just didn't fit my new bed)."},

The reverse of the protector had a heavier plastic lining, which I assume is what catches the moisture before it gets to your mattress. I like that feature.. I washed it before placing it on the bed because it had a plastic smell.  The smell mostly came out upon washing it.  I washed it on a \"cool\" normal cycle and dried it at medium heat.  It dried in one dryer cycle for me. It also dried well; it still fit on the mattress afterwards and was intact.. All in all, I would recommend this item to others.

I do not find it hot or crinkly as others have stated, and we do not have air conditioning!  If it lasts as long as the first mattress protector (about 7 years), I will be very happy.

It is completely water proof without a crinkly feel.  It does have a slight different feel than just a sheet on the mattress but you get used to it very quickly.  I bought other brands for my children's beds and they all have that same feel but this one is my favorite.  I have washed and dried it many times and it still looks like new.

I've tried a few other covers, and they all either made terrible sounds, or just felt like I was sleeping on a tarp. The smooth top of the SafeRest means you won't ever hear or feel it.  You may not think you need a waterproof mattress protector past the age of 5, but you'd be surprised how many little spills and accidents can add up.  An unexpected bloody nose in the middle of the night shouldn't soil your $2000 mattress.  Finally, the safe rest mattress protector gives a nice snug fit on any sized mattress.  As I use a foam topper this is something I really value, as the mattress protector holds the foam topper in place and keeps it from sliding off to one side when moving around."},

Then out of nowhere it will never give us the same reading twice.  Step on and it says I'm 116, step off and let it reset, step back on now I'm 135.  It's been giving us a 35 lb variation in both directions.  You can take 10 readings back to back and not one of them will be a duplicate.  We've tried moving it to make sure it's on a flat surface, changing batteries, etc... nothing works.  It also used to give the same weight regardless of where your feet were... now it varies largely (you way more if your feet are near the edges and weigh less if your feet are close together in the middle)."},

I'm curious why, if this is an anomaly, the CSR from the first 2 I bought said it may have to do with \"bubbles in my water.\" This is strange.

All told, we're pulling the topper over about 15-16\" of mattress, topper, and linens.  The mattress protector has very large pockets, and fits securely over all of that.  When there's an accident, we just toss it in the washer -- no special considerations needed, though it does take longer to dry than most bed linens.. I think that it would also be comfortable to use as intended.  The top is a nice terry cloth, and the sides are thin enough that they wouldn't add any bulk.. UPDATE:  We did start using the cover as intended, because one of the kittens is still having morning accidents.  Still very pleased -- it's easy to put on, makes a good moisture barrier, and has held up to tiny claws and many washings.  It does take a long time to dry, so we bought a second one for quick swaps.  It may make the bed a little warmer than normal, but not enough to bother me or my husband."},

Next big issue with me is finding a cover that's deep enough that I don't have to struggle to completely cover the sides of the mattress.  I hate all of that tugging.  No problem there.  It covers well with extra fabric should it shrink over time.  Don't worry though.  There isn't extra fabric hanging down or anything.  Lastly, some of the mattress covers I've owned were so thick that they were hard to get in our washing machine.  We don't need padding with our mattress.

Now I don't have to worry about them when their hanging out in my room. I recommend this to everyone. Don't find out the hard way that you need one."},

We wash them all and layer liner then sheet set, liner and sheet set 2, liner and sheet set 3. Most of the time I just have to pull off the top set of sheets and liner and the next one is ready to go. These make my life so much easier.

With dogs, hairs shedding and other undesirable things can filter through to my sleeping territory.. This mattress cover is the absolute best protection that I have found. No dog hairs come through the waterproof side at all. Not only that, but the underside (the waterproof side) feels very silky, very pleasant to the touch. Not at all like plastic underside I've seen on my other mattress covers. Another bonus for me is the top of this mattress cover is a flannel-like fabric that keeps the cover/bedspread in place no matter how often the dog(s) jump on the bed. I like it better than the padded/quilted version.. An excellent find for me. Plan on ordering a couple of backups when the budget permits so that I can replace the cover currently on my mattress itself and have a spare for laundry day.."},

The filters initially work like the regular filters, but after about a month, the flow of water went from what was expected to unbelievably slow. I will fill the pitcher up overnight, expecting all the water to flow through by morning, but that doesn't happen. Only about a quarter to half of the water is filtered overnight (7-8 hours). I can't believe how long it takes to filter through about 2-3 cups of water. It's ridiculous!

For what it's worth I've been using Brita for over 10 years and while there was a noticeable difference in the taste of the water from the traditional Brita filters, the LongLast filters seem to be defective & are only pushing out the same quality tap water which we're putting in."},

Or until I grow tired of my kids not refilling the pitcher and putting it back in the fridge and chuck it and go back to using the sink faucet.  At which time I'll probably have at least two of these left and I'll probably keep them around for years because they're perfectly good, so why throw them away?

The taste is great - we live in South Florida which is known for not so great water.. We even purchased a water kit and the brita filters keep our water ph balanced.. I am not sure what people mean by a poor seal - I have never had this issue but it is plastic on plastic with water - for us it doesnt slide unless we angle it too far upside down..

Plus a huge puddle of urine, and I think some vomit might have been included as well (it was kind of hard to tell at that point). It took it happening one or two more times before we realized our dog had an odd, mild case of separation anxiety that results in her releasing bodily fluids (and sometimes solids) on our bed. Needless to say, she's not allowed in our bedroom when we're gone anymore.. Back to the mattress protector - it did it's job pretty well. During the first episode there was some slight moisture from the urine that made it's way onto our mattress. It was negligible, but I wouldn't assume this can completely handle everything thrown it's way. Still, it did a pretty fantastic job. It cleans very, very well. It's not noisy or stiff, and I usually forget we have it on our bed. A surprising bonus is that it also helps to keep sheets on the bed if your sheets have a bad habit of coming up at the edges. It's also stretchy and has deep pockets, so it should fit even very thick mattresses."},

It is waterproof, which sort of annoys my husband who sweats a lot. At least it does protect his mattress from all his sweat!. As long as you don't put it in a hot dryer (low setting works fine) it should last for 5 years without any issues at least!. This cover slips over the top and sides of a mattress, much like a fitted sheet. It comes in the \"hard-to-find\" twin-XL size, and fit our deep tempur-pedic mattresses just fine.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great Scale!", "review_body": "Losing weight can be difficult when you can't monitor your progress. For most of my life, I have been slightly overweight. Now that I am in college I have the chance to become a healthier and happier me! There were a lot of times I was set on losing weight but ended up quitting because I felt I was making no progress. Now that I have this scale, I can finally track my progress!. This scale came on time and was nicely packaged. I've had this scale for about two weeks now and have already lost 4 pounds with proper diet and exercise. To make sure you get accurate results, you need to place the scale on a hard flat surface (no carpet, it messes up the result) and step on it until the number flashes a few times and stops. If you step off and then on again right away, the results will not be accurate. You have to wait until the number resets.. What I like about this scale is the sleek look and the bright numbers. I use to have a non digital scale that was annoying to use because the numbers were hard to see from a distance. If I crouched down to read them, the number would change. With this digital scale the numbers are very easy to see. And if I wasn't wearing my glasses, I could step off once it weighed me and then look closer at the number (which lingers around for a few seconds).. The only thing that I do not like about this scale is the fact it is made out of glass. I am a very clumsy person and ended up dropping it onto concrete, completely shattering it. This is not the fault of the product, it was mine. If you are clumsy as well, I would advise you to be careful.. Overall, lovely scale! I can't wait to be a healthier me."},

I don\u2019t mind paying for quality but I normally just use my paper towels around the house for cleaning the bathroom, quick spills and those dirty little jobs. Most the times I buy the good old cheap generic paper towels since I\u2019m just going to throw them away. Bounty however has changed my outlook on them. I am really impressed with this product. The quality of them are thick and nicely made. They absorb stuff well. I was able to clean my bathroom mirror, bathroom sink and wipe down the toilet all with basically the size of one sheet of my generic paper towels which I would\u2019ve used close to 10 or more to do the same job.  Let\u2019s just say I was impressed on how well they held up. The only disadvantage I saw was using it to clean my mirror first it did tend to leave some streaks that my generic paper towel does not. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s something that it\u2019s made out of.  The select a size is really nice to pick the right size for the job. I was overly impressed with the durability and usability of this product. This is a big box of paper towels and each roll is like a supersized roll compared to the cheap ones I normally use. Overall I absolutely love this product. I think I will be investing the money in the future to continue to use them.  Overall the cost is about the same as you can use a lot less to achieve the same results.  Well done Bounty!  You have a new customer for life."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Bounty is Consistently Good, and the \"Quick-Size\" is Perfect", "review_body": "Our family has used many different paper towel brands over the years. Although I grew up using Bounty at home, I typically just pick up whatever is on sale at the local supermarket for my own family, often with mixed results. Bounty has been the one paper towel brand we\u2019ve used that is consistently dependable, strong, absorbent, and versatile enough for multiple jobs. So I was more than happy to try out this pack of Bounty Quick-Size Paper Towels.. The pack contained eight 2-roll packages for a total of 16 rolls. I really liked that the sheets were perforated at the smaller \u201cQuick-Size\u201d which I measured at 5\u00be inches by just under 11 inches. The smaller sheets are more than enough to handle most jobs around the kitchen and beyond.. I\u2019ve used these sheets for just about every cleaning or drying job around the house. I keep a roll in our car, which has come in handy on more than one occasion already. Beyond the great job that these paper towels do on spills, they are also good for wiping down and drying glass because they don\u2019t leave lots of little fibers like some other paper towel brands. They also do an excellent job absorbing oil and grease. The Bounty paper towels are so strong even when wet that sometimes i'll even use the sheets to soap up my pans to preserve their teflon coating. These Quick-Size sheets have worked very well for all our family\u2019s needs."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great Pick-Up In A Convenient Jumbo Size", "review_body": "Through years of trial and error, our family has concluded Bounty makes the best paper towels.  Now they\u2019ve gone one step further by making bigger sized rolls.  I store extra paper towels down in our basement---anything that saves me from repeatedly going down there is a plus.  Like mega toilet paper, these last about twice as long as regular paper towel rolls, and getting them in bulk eases up shopping time too.. A regular Bounty (Select-A-Size) roll has 84 sheets per roll.  This Quick size has 143 sheets per roll.  I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll work with some newer style roll holders, but they fit just fine in the old-fashioned holder that hangs under a shelf in our laundry room.  Width wise\u2014a regular roll measures about 5\u201d across; this quick size measures about 6\u201d across.  The trade-off is this jumbo roll is slightly smaller in sheet size than select-a-size (11\" x 5.9\" versus 11\" x 5.7\").  You\u2019ll never notice that negligible difference when cleaning up messes\u2014one sheet still gets most household jobs picked up fast and effectively..

I have purchased them for many years and have always been happy.  They absorb well and hold up great.  They don't tend to shred or fall apart on me...ever.. I switched to their Select-a-Size rolls several years ago, and I think that they're simply half the size of the \"regular\" sheets.  I like being able to use less paper when I don't need a full sheet.  These Quick-Size sheets are a little bit smaller than the Select-a-Size (just as tall, but not quite as wide).  For most things, these are just fine, and (once again) I like using less paper.  At first, I thought that these would be too small for some things - but they really haven't been.. I applaud the move towards using even less paper, and if you like the Select-a-Size, I say give these a try to see if they'll also work for you.  They aren't that much different, honestly, but they do save a little bit of paper on each towel.. Also, these Family Rolls are about the size of whatever I've been buying for years at Target, so they don't seem too large to me and they fit on my paper towel holder just fine."},

These paper towels are strong, durable and get the job done. Because of the quality, these well work and are much less wasteful. I find myself reaching for them more than I had full size sheets for smaller spills where a full sheet would have been too much. I even grab them as napkins for messier meals and they are great for that too! They are much thicker and better than a generic store brand, as well as some other name brands. They do not shred on tougher jobs. I highly recommend them."},

Always buy select a size, but this time ordered quick size by mistake. They try telling you it is more sheets; they don't say that is only because they are smaller. They are also thinner. Today's shipment has 124 feet, while select a size has 142. Big difference! Very unhappy with this change! So much better when select a size available. Next time I need paper towels I will try some other brand. Have been Bounty customer ever since they started which is a long time."},

My boyfriend and I choose to buy paper plates occasionally because if we're microwaving a small snack, our heavy duty real plates have had trouble with cracking, so we use paper plates. We also use paper plates if we've run out of dishes and haven't run the dishwasher yet. We try to avoid it whenever we can, but we have these at home to use as a backup.. This brand in particular has been our go-to lately. The plates are pretty thick, so even when you microwave something slightly liquidy, the goo won't seep through the plate and onto your table. An old brand we used had to be doubled up with two plates in cases like these, so I'm glad we no longer have to do that.. Similarly, the thickness helps when using a knife on this plate. Unlike with other paper plates, these plates don't tear easily when you cut on them.. Overall these are very useful paper plates.

These plates are nice and thick so you can load them with way more calories than you should be eating: perfect for those lonely nights while you sit around wishing you had more friends. The 240 pack is actually 10 packs of 24 plates. This is fantastic because every time you start to run out of plates you suddenly realize that you have more plates, and your mood is suddenly heightened and you're ready to eat even more food!. If you are a lazy man with a significant other in your life like me, then your significant other will love the fact that they have less dishes to do now, and might even cook more!

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Works great!", "review_body": "This is a super thin matress protector that I bought for my two year old who was moving from a toddler bed to a full size. She sometimes leaks through her diaper and I needed something to completely protect the mattress (and it's warrenty). On the third day, it happened. I felt the top of the protector and it was wet. I felt underneath and it was cold - but not wet. I felt the mattress and it was also cold, but bone dry! It was a decent leak, so it's doing its job!. As far as smell, I did not notice anything too unusual once I put it on the bed - and I'm pregnant right now, so my nose picks up everything. There's also no sound when my daughter rolls around on it. AND she's a jumper, and it hasn't moved out of place on the mattress. It's designed for deep mattresses, so her 8 inch mattress has a lot of extra underneath, but it does not bunch up on the sides, it fits great all underneath the bed. I washed it in cold water and dried it on low heat and it came out looking the same as new. I will buy this brand again for kid #2.. Please note that this is a very thin protector and will not add much, if any softness to the bed. That's not what it's for and not why I bought it."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Perfect fit, great price!", "review_body": "We needed a mattress protector for our new custom-made camper bed.

I did what probably most parents do in the middle of the night and threw a thick blanket over the wet spot and put her back in bed. The next morning I stripped the bed and was sooo pleased that not a bit of wetness was on the mattress! There was no smell of urine either. The mattress protector did its job wonderfully. I washed it on normal setting then hung it to dry. I don't know if that's what the instructions said to do but I have ruined mattress protectors before by drying them in the dryer so I played it safe. It's not the softest mattress cover I've felt but it goes under a sheet so that doesn't matter to me. It fits her 6\" mattress with tons of room to spare so it would fit a much thicker mattress. It does not come loose or off the corners at all. I would definitely recommend this product."},

I was a little hesitant when I read that it had a terrycloth surface, but decided to give it a try anyway.  It is very comfortable.  The sheets don't move around underneath us as non-slip surface of the protector seems to hold them in place very well.  This is very important to me as I do not have a deep pocket mattress and find that the sheet and mattress pad would bunch up after just one night.  I have washed and dried it by machine a couple of times now (though the directions state to hang dry) and it still looks and feels like new.  I also like that it is thinner than a quilted mattress pad and takes up much less room when folded.  It seems to be truly waterproof, yet doesn't feel or sound like a plastic lined cover would.  I will be ordering another one of these."},

I did buy this item based on the reviews here, and the price was right.  I wanted something to protect our brand new almost-$2,000 king mattress set from stains because their warranty almost sets up their customers for failure because they void their warranty if there are stains on it.  However, because it's new with all this great techno stuff, I also wanted to make sure that we can feel the actual mattress we paid for, and for us it's true that it doesn't interfere with us feeling our actual mattress.. It doesn't have a scent.  It is made of a very thin terry cloth on one side (touching the sheets) and a plastic cover underneath (touching the mattress).  It fits like a fitted sheet, so it is not zippered and therefore technically wouldn't keep mites out.  Once you put the sheet on top of it, you can't hear the plastic when you move around.  Our mattress is 14\" and includes a pillow top, and it fits well.  So that we can always have a clean one around, we're buying a second one!"},

It shipped quickly and arrived in time to wash it before the new mattress was delivered. Despite being King sized, it easily fit in my small washing machine with the king sized sheets. It did take a little bit longer to dry, though, but the very plush terry fabric came out nice and soft and didn't feel crunchy, so I didn't mind. It fit the extra deep mattress very well and I was thankful to not have to work very hard at stretching it over the mattress.  My husband, baby and I climbed into our new bed and settled in to sleep. Around 2 am, we woke to the unmistakable sound of baby gagging and before we could react, our new bed and linens were filled with vomit.

Other reviewers have reported some amount of crinkling noise, but I haven\u2019t noticed any.. Even though other reviewers had mixed experiences with its water resistance, I decided to buy this mattress protector anyways because the customer support responses seemed accommodating. After it arrived, I did a quick test of its waterproof qualities by stretching a portion over a bucket, terrycloth side up, and pouring a small amount of water onto it. The water didn\u2019t soak through, which is great!. I\u2019ve repeated this test after each time that I\u2019ve washed it to the same results, but I\u2019d still recommend testing it before putting it onto a bed to avoid potentially damaging a mattress if some problem has occurred with it!"},

I love that it is thick and does not billow. I previously had thinner ones and when my elbow would hit them while washing my hair, it would billow inward and then cling to my arm and body. Since I have long hair and it takes a while to lather, condition, and rinse, the billowing and clinging was very annoying. This one stays where it is supposed to!.  I just throw it into the washer with a couple of towels. Then I throw them all in the dryer for just about 5 minutes (just till the vinyl is warm) and then hang the liner back on the rod to dry. One edge of the hem seemed to collect a tiny bit of water and mildewed. I put a drop of chlorine bleach down the hem and it vanished. I love the clear curtain because it lets in light and I don't have a light above the tub. I hang a decorative shower curtain outside of this liner!!"},

Purchased from the infamous \"W\" store (whose door I never darken again), I allowed it to accumulate mildew and soap film until it was physically revolting to take a shower.  I loved the many positive reviews for the LIBA SHOWER CURTAIN, so a few weeks back I purchased this item, and enthusiastically hung it in my tub.  I shower daily (sometimes more than once), and after several weeks the LIBA is just as clear, clean, and fresh as the day it was hung.  Plus I love that it's totally clear and lets the bathroom light in.  Talk about illuminating!. Time will tell if this curtain will continue to repel bacteria and be mildew resistant.  But so far so good!  I really lather up when I shower, so plenty of soap goes on this liner; thus far it looks as clear as the day it was delivered.  Clean and clear:  That's what a shower curtain should be.  Looks like the LIBA SHOWER CURTAIN is right on the money.. ~D. Mikels, Esq."},

They are often pungent, unwieldy and poorly crafted. Installing this shower curtain, I'm pleased to say, was nothing like past experiences. This item is very well made, making it an excellent value when you consider price, and had the exact number of grommets as the curtain it was protecting. This could be mere coincidence, or there was some sort of consensus or standard set in the shower curtain/liner industry, but it made me a very happy customer. I often hung these things only to realize I ran out of rings halfway through installing the liner, leaving the rest to hang into the tub like a depressed relative of Gumby. To top this off there are no harsh vapors when you open the bag and the magnets to an admirable job keeping the shower liner moored to the tub wall instead of allowing it to do that creepy, floating ghost curtain thing...you know...where it tries to stick to you? Anyway, even if you're unfamiliar...rest assured it doesn't do that. Great product."},

So far, I have had the same one up inside of my shower for 6 months, only needing minor cleaning on a bi-weekly basis. I find using a magic eraser really helps too.

I would give it 5 stars except that it only comes with 3 magnets and they are not strong enough to prevent billowing of the curtain while you are showering.  I sort of \"paste\" it to the tub by running the shower head the length of the bottom of it and this does a fairly good job of keeping it from coming lose and sticking to you (yuck!!!).

I finally had enough and looked for mildew resistant curtains on Amazon to find this one. I have had this curtain in my shower for over six months now, and I haven't run into any issues with mildew or mold. The curtain stays clear, due in part to rinsing it after every shower.

Also, no \"chemical\" smell and is made from PEVA - very important to me because I have a toddler and baby who also use this shower/bath combo.  The clear is definitely \"clear\".

It lasted a year in a bathroom that has fairly bad mold issues, plus that's way longer than I've ever had a shower curtain last ANYWHERE, so I'm pretty pleased with it and happy to buy another.. I wish the little metal eyelets didn't rust -- I don't know WHAT they're talking about claiming it's rust-free, because uhhh, NO -- but it's not a big enough deal for me to dock a star or anything.

I weighed myself before peeing to test it, then proceeded to pee out about a cup, which should weigh about half a pound. It didn't pick it up at all. It read the exact same weight after I lost the half pound.. It is usually accurate enough to notice when I unload my pockets though, so I would say the margin of error is probably within a pound.

I like the design, like the display, and have no reason to think the pounds are inaccurate. But the ounces/number after the decimal is weird. First off, when first stepping on the scale to calibrate, it always says 3.4lbs, no matter what I put on it. So I think this first number is just a display (not real). Next, I've been weighing myself everyday for 3 months straight, and this is what I've found: the scale only ever displays: 147.6, 148.2, 149.0, 150.2, 151.0, (etc). NEVER 147.8, 149.6, etc. I actually wrote these numbers down and am referencing my list. So I think the scale is not actually precise down to fractions of pounds, and it just displays a pre-determined number after the decimal to make it look fancier. But again, the pounds themselves seem accurate so I don't have a problem with the scale overall."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great price, good accuracy, but feels a little bit flimsy.", "review_body": "I recently purchased this scale for my bathroom - and overall it was an amazing purchase. I bought it expected something mediocre (after all, it was less than $20!) but when it arrived I was extremely pleasantly surprised.. The good:. The price: For under $20, I couldn't be happier. I wanted a basic, bare-bones device that would tell me my weight, and I got it - except with a slick finish and an aesthetically pleasing design.. The design: This scale looks absolutely gorgeous - it has a very nice gloss finish, but doesn't smudge too badly. Overall I'm very happy.. The experience: Putting in the batteries (which were included, by the way!) was very easy - no screwdriver needed. There was a pushbutton on the back that could be used to change it from lbs to kg, and it was very easy to use. The actual operation of the scale is very nice too: you just stand on it and it turns on automatically, and displays your weight.. The bad:. The surface: The surface is very slick and smooth, as I mentioned previously. It looks fantastic, but I can imagine it would be very slippery if your feet were wet (as if you'd just come out of the shower). A minor issue, but something to consider.. The flimsiness: My one major complaint with this scale would be the flimsiness. My roommate described it as \"standing on an iPad\". When you step on it, the body flexes and shifts - which is a little bit unnerving. The scale is rated to 400lbs, and I have no doubt it will easily withstand that, but it does make me a little nervous every time I step on. Again - a minor complaint for an overall amazing product."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Wonderful product at a very fair price", "review_body": "I brought an elderly parent home to live with me and had to get suddenly serious about mattress protection.  The SafeRest Premium Hypoallergenic Waterproof Mattress Protectors are just wonderful and fit my needs perfectly. I immediately reordered for every bed in my house and some extra for the laundry closet.  The top of the pad is a soft thin cotton terry that wicks away moisture to the waterproof underside.  No plastic feeling or sound at all. It washes easily and dries on low heat. We then purchased a more comfortable adjustable bed with a memory foam mattress in lieu of a hospital bed.  The memory foam mattresses are thinner than the deep pocket mattress norm now. After receiving SafeRest through Amazon I was surprised to see the same type mattress cover at the mattress store for $119 each! That's almost four SafeRests at Amazon prices! Stock up! (If you have a deep pocketed mattress, no worries.  The pockets on the SafeRest are deep - 18\", but easily stretch bigger if needed. The side material is pliable and easy to stretch.) The thin memory foam mattress solution is not to buy the outrageously priced specialty sheets, mattress covers, etc., but to buy the inexpensive mattress clips or straps that make all sheets and mattress covers a perfect fit. I read that some adjustable bed users have trouble with the linens coming off at the corners, but the clips and the SafeRest mattress covers are great.  And even older mattresses get an instant level of protection from dust, mites, and other creepy things you might not be able to see. A great purchase, and I'm about to buy more."},

I was afraid it might get cloudy but so far, still clear as a bell.

This one is quite the opposite. It's completely quiet and you would never know I have a cover on my mattress by the feel. With that being said, the main reason for my 5 star rating is that it survived the ultimate test: my roommate's cat peeing all over my bed. It soaked all through my bedding and onto the cover, but the cover completely kept it off of my mattress. Those of you with memory foam mattresses know once moisture is in there, it's never coming out, so I was very happy and impressed that this cover actually lived up to its claims. It was also easy to clean and came out spotless. You can't beat this cover for the price!"},

Also, the material is (so far) resisting any mildew or mold, which was a huge issue with previous liners bought at Wal-Mart and bed/bath stores.  The magnets don't stick to the sides of my tub, but I don't blame that on the product; that has more to do with the coating and material of the tub itself, so be aware it may be hit or miss for you as far as the magnets working properly.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I like to check my weight daily", "review_body": "I like to check my weight daily, naked, just before stepping into the shower. I record it in the Apple Health app, and periodically export that data into a spreadsheet where I can correlate it my food log and try to spot trends or problems. (Yes, I'm a data nerd).. I've got a professional physician beam scale that I bought several years ago, but it is too big and awkward for the small bathroom that has my shower, so resides in the bigger bathroom on the other side of the house. I don't want to walk naked all the way across the house and back for my morning weigh in, especially on cold winter days, and so I bought this Etekcity scale for the shower bathroom.. It works well and simply. Step on it, wait for the numbers to stop changing and start flashing, and then step off and read the result. It sells for cheap, but does not give the impression of being cheaply built.. Occasionally I've had my doubts. For instance, a while back I seriously pigged out, eating a whole pizza (3.5 pounds of pizza!). My next morning weigh in showed a new low weight, under my previous low by about 1 pound. I thought, \"What the heck is wrong with this scale? Surely I'm still carrying at least a pound or two of that pizza around...\", and so made the naked trek across the house to check with the professional physician beam scale...and it too showed a new low. In fact, according the physician mean scale, I was about 0.5 lower than the Etekcity scale claimed!. That has been the consistent pattern whenever I've directly compared the Etekcity with the beam scale. The beam scale consistently reads about 0.5 pounds lower than the Etekcity.. I don't know if the beam scale is right and the Etekcity reads a little high, or the Etekcity is right and the beam scale reads a little low, or if the truth is in the middle with the beam scale a little low and the Etekcity a little high.. What's important is that doesn't really matter. If you are buying a scale to monitor your weight for health reasons, what matters is consistency, not absolute accuracy. If your scale tells you are 1 pound heavier that you really are, or 1 pound lighter, or whatever, as long as it does that consistently you can accurately figure out changes in your weight, and that is what you really need to know.. I've been using this scale daily since I bought it 9 months ago, and it is still going find on the original batteries. Sometimes I use it more than once a day, when I have a reason to think that there has been a major intake or outflow of mass (South Park fans will know what I'm talking about...).. I'm giving this 5 stars for now--it works consistently, it sells for cheap, but does not give the impression of being cheaply built.. When the batteries finally die, I'm going to replace them with Eneloop rechargeable batteries. If it handles those fine, I'll leave it at 5 stars. Some devices get confused with rechargeable batteries, and start falsely reporting that you need to change the batteries. If it does that I'll come back and knock off some stars."},

I live in a university dorm and the water from our sink is less than optimal in my opinion. To help combat the taste and chlorine smell, I bough the filter and a pitcher and have been getting non-smelly, unclorinated water which I love. The reason I took off one star is because of two reasons:. You need to replace the filter when your water does not taste nor smell \"clean\", do not always go by the indicator light on your pitcher. It's simply \"pour sensitive\" and just counts how many times you pour water from the pitcher and eventually says you need to change it.. 2) Despite following directions not to pour water directly onto the filter during filling, large specks of carbon like to detatch from the filter and float around inside the filtering basin. Not that big of a deal, but not awesome either.. Overall I am very satisfied with my filter and encourage the use of this product to help reduce plastic bottle waste."},

What I mean is that I use a paper towel holder that is under the counter mount and the holder has the wand the holds the roll of paper towels. each time I try to tear off a sheet the whole wand would fall off from the base. It drives me nuts. That does not happen with other brands I use. usually the wand is so secure to the base I usually have trouble removing it but When I use the Viva towels it does that.

The fact that I did buy a second one demonstrates that I have been pleased with it.  I do think that it breathes better than most.  For those afraid of a mattress pad failing, I would recommend layering them.  I also take the gerber or circo crib mattress covers which are really just a rectangle of protection and lay it under the child's bed sheet directly where we would have the most issues.

I would personally rather have a quilted top protector with these features the SafeRest one provides: breathable, noiseless, fitted sheet style, fits up to 14 inches.

If you are just looking to check your weight once a week and are not concerned with .2 of a pound this will work great.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Pure quality.", "review_body": "It's taller than my old one(that I got from walmart), the batteries are easy enough to get, (which I will this weekend,) and it's ability to weigh as a digital one is remarkably fast. I barely stepped on it and it immediately weighed that pressure. I stepped on, and although I moved, unlike my old one, it adjusted to that pretty quickly till it seemed I held still long enough for it. Instructions were simple. Pull out plastic battery-blocker from the battery door, place on a dry floor, and boom! Measured.. For KG, there's a button that literally has, 'kg,' above it. Easy swap..

I usually weigh twice in a row from there to make sure my weigh-in is accurate t is usually consistent between the two weights.  It is fairly light and easy to position in a flat area."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Initially I loved it because of the number it showed but on a real note, this is a great scale and I'm crazy picky about scales!", "review_body": "So this is the second scale I've purchased in about 2 months or so. I really wanted an accurate scale for a while now, simple in that it wouldn't log my weight for the next person to see (I'm a young single female - I don't want unsavory to my standards weight numbers popping up when some boy comes over and goes to my bathroom haha) Call me typical but that's probably the only area I'd say I could be called such lol.. Anyway back to the actual point of writing this - I scoured through so many reviews before I finally bought my first scale and it already does not work any longer (it is under warranty but I personally think it's a pain to send back something that is somewhat minimal on the scale of expensive items) so I decided to just buy a new one and not be crazy about trying to find exactly  which ones best.. However, I will say that if you're like me and feel weary at times when seeing a ton of reviews written by people who received a discount or free product in exchange, I'm here to be one of the ones who paid full price and have no incentive to be writing this. I just want to help others like me who never know what's quality and what is all smoke and paid reviews with no true assurance of whether you're going to end up with a good or bad product.. This scale I chose rather quickly after seeing it was rather popular items in percentage of high satisfaction (without any sneaky 50% 5 stars 30% 1 star type items like many others I've come across) and also because basically it met exactly what I was looking for. Normally I would've shopped around longer but considering the scale I spent forever deciding on broke just by trying to change the batteries, I just went for it.. First, let me say that I'm only biased at my first love reaction to this scale due to the display of such a pleasing number upon first stepping on it. Haha :) but on a more serious note, it's proven to be an optimal well-functioning product; it's very sleek, came in perfect packaged condition, and for me is consistent in accuracy of my day to day weighing. Before writing this I saw reviews stating it wasn't accurate for others so I actually just went to test it tonigh and it came back the exact same weight to the .0 digit which I honestly wasn't even expecting nor planning to fault it for if it hadn't. If a scale is consistent within 1 pound, I consider it good quality so this is just bonus points once again!. But to end this accidentally long review here - honestly, if you want a scale that gives an accurate weight, looks very nice and minimal/sleek, and doesn't have a ton of extras that you aren't needing or wanting like myself, I would absolutely say buy this one. I'm very glad that I did and am about to go admire my current weight after submitting this!"},

After about 2 weeks they stopped filtering and it would take about a day to get an entire pitcher's worth. I threw it out and put in the second filter from the pack. The same thing happened about 2 weeks later also. I wrote to Brita who said they had \"reformulated\" to fix the issue and sent me a free 2-pack.

I never use it.  Do your own  fluoride research is horrible for humans.. So here's the absolute deal breakers or me ... I make my own kombucha like product and the truth is, my product will NOT culture in chlorinated water. No, it won't. Chlorine kill bacteria and good bacteria.  Usually my product it will culture over night.  Well the culture have been killed by this  so called \"filtered\" water.  So if the culture gets killed you get the idea.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Confirmed: Huge", "review_body": "The diameter of the hole of these rolls is 40mm. The outer diameter of the roll is 140mm. The halfway point between those is a diameter of 90mm. The average circumference of each layer of paper towel is therefore pi x 90 = 307.44mm. Using a micrometer I have determined that the thickness of a single paper towel is .64mm. Since there are 50mm of thickness on each side of the roll, there must be 78.125 layers of paper towel, i.e. 78 layers with an overlap of .125 of the circumference of an average layer. With an average circumference of 307.44mm, the total length of the towels must be 24018.75mm. The width of each sheet is 6\", or 152.4mm. This means there must be 157.6 sheets. Rounding off, 158 is a fair representation of the number of sheets on each roll.. I can therefore confirm that these rolls are, according to my calculations, indeed huge.. They also seem to be strong and absorbent, but I haven't confirmed that mathematically."},

My favorite feature is the Flex-A-Size, because we usually don't need a whole sheet for household messes (cleaning little faces and hands, wiping up a spill, etc...)

I have used them before, as I have a cat with litterbox issues, and let's face it. It's LOADS easier to wash a sheet than a mattress.. This cover is ideal; not only is it super protective but you don't even know it's there! You wouldn't think by looking at it that it's waterproof. But it is, withOUT using a vinyl backing! I have used that style too but it always bothered me feeling like I was sleeping on a toddler's or hospital bed - that noise of the sheet drove me nuts. This is noiseless, lightweight, and durable.. As a bonus it's allergen protective too. Definitely a great deal, and I would highly recommend to anyone."},

I was indeed in bed when my water broke and am very glad all that fluid was not soaked up into our mattress!  Afterwards my MIL took it off and washed it, and we've put it back on the bed in case anything else child-related threatens our mattress!  It is not noticeable at all (no noise or difference in our sheet's friction).  It's a great product, and a good value."},

We have a memory foam mattress so heat dissipation is already a concern for us and I barely notice this cover is even on.  It sheds heat well and is not loud (contrary to some other reviews).  We haven't had to test how waterproof it truly is yet and hope we never have to.  We adopted a young american bulldog and were worried about him having accidents in the bed so in my opinion this is cheap insurance for our mattress.. As some others have said the instructions for washing this say to dry it on very low heat but I have read many recommendations that say to NEVER DRY IT.  Just let it air dry, the heat from the dryer affects the waterproof membrane and apparently it doesn't take much."},

This mattress protector fits the depth of my mattress easily, and my personal favorite feat, is that it's not noisy nor does it feel like plastic. I don't feel like or hear sounds as if I were sleeping on a plastic-wrapped chair! It's an awesome mattress protector, and the price was right.  The business, as I've learned, is small and family-owned, so I'm happy to support this business who makes awesome products!

I didn't need or want a really expensive new mattress, but did want something comfortable in an extra-long twin.  This mattress took 3 days for the foam to puff up and fill out the full advertised length.  It also needed a couple of days to air out the foam smell.  It is not super firm, but it is very comfortable.  More comfortable than the previous twin mattress that cost much more!  It arrived on schedule, cleanly packaged.  It definitely was a good buy and is exactly what I needed for the grandchildren that are all taller than I am.  You will need a platform or some type of frame, but it is a nice mattress!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Fits Well and Doesn\u2019t Affect Mattress Comfort", "review_body": "Bought this to protect a new queen sized mattress. My wife and I were told that the mattress would be covered by the warranty so long as we did not stain it and recommended us buying a mattress protector. Rather than buy an overpriced one from the salesman we opted to look on amazon.. This is one of the first options that came up on the search and it had a lot of reviews with a majority of them being favorable. Ordered it and a few days later we had it in time for the arrival of our new mattress.. I was concerned that the protector would either be plasticky or like paper and would feel stiff or make noises on our new mattress. I am pleased to say that it is neither stiff or loud and we don\u2019t lose out on any of the benefits of the new mattress. It installed as easy as a bed sheet and as you can see from one of my pictures, it easily fit over the very thick mattress.. I haven\u2019t tested the water/stain proofing yet which is the major reason we bought this but I will test it with some water and update my review. Right now I like it and am glad I didn\u2019t spend twice as much from the salesman. For the fact that it doesn\u2019t change the comfort of my mattress while protecting it and does it for a reasonable price I can happily recommend it."},

I have a few cases where it will read 2 lbs heavier, and then I do two more readings that are 2 lbs lighter.. One year update: My biggest complaint and I dropped the number of stars to 4 is that this scale has what I call a \"pre-C\" reading and a \"post-C\" reading. I stepped on the scale this morning and was provided a number that I didn't like. I saw the scale display a \"C\", and then 0.0, and then stepped on again, and I dropped close to 3 lbs. So, as I start my annual ritual of trying to shed some pounds again, which number do I keep track of it, or do I average them?

This item worked well out of the box and looks fantastic! but, after only 12 days it has already started to deteriorate.  I usually only weigh myself one time each morning to track my weight when i get out of bed.  However i recently decided to weigh myself at least twice and found that this scale gave me different measurements each time with a difference of over a pound!  I did not have any time between measurements so I should have weighed the same both times.  for people who just want a baseline estimate of weight this would work great. I use this to track my weight and adjust my diet to achieve a 1 pound per week weight loss and as such having a scale that deviates 1 pound in either direction is unacceptable."},

I weighed myself before a doctors appointment once, and I was 5 lbs lighter at the doctors than on the scale at home. This is extremely frustrating, especially if you are trying to lose/gain weight.

Besides that confusing moment it has worked pretty well. It's nice that it's not noisy and crinkly like the old school mattress protectors used to be and it's soft. The price is reasonable too.. My son had a bout of stomach flu one evening and it did a good job of protecting the mattress from that nastiness as well. It washes up nicely and there doesn't seem to be any adverse affects from washing and drying it regularly.

I wanted something that wouldn't feel too \"crunchy\".. I got this product quickly, and immediately put it on her bed (before washing it).. Wouldn't you know, two days later she wakes up and peed through her pull-up.. I ran to the bed, crossing my fingers hoping this mattress pad didn't fail me, I don't want her new mattress to be pee covered already!!. The mattress pad was soaking wet. It doesn't look good for the mattress. I peel the pad off the bed, and run my hands all around the mattress, and....DRY!! Bone dry, actually! I was very impressed.. I only bought one at the time, so I had to wash it immediately, so of could put it back on for bedtime.. I washed it in cold, with the rest of the wet sheets. I usually would not put it in the dryer, and would hang dry it, but I needed it to be dry quickly, so I threw it in the dryer. It came out in one piece, clean and dry..

His mattress is a pillow top and has a 2 inch memory foam on top of that.

One thing to keep in mind that DO NOT weight yourself while the machine is on carpet or any soft floor. The material underneath it will absorb some of your weight and the machine will claim that you are 30 lbs lighter. Always weigh yourself by keeping this on hard wood floor or tiles."},

You can also simply move it to the other end of the bathroom for an instantly gratifying 1.5 lbs of weight loss. I have to admit, I find myself moving it around just to get that extra lb off.

Shipping was very quick and it came shipped with a battery (that still has juice a month later). I was using a vintage scale before but I wanted a digital scale so I could see day by day exactly how my weight has fluxuated. I looks very sleek in my bathroom. I have a tiny bathroom so I love how it easily stands up beside my toilet. I also like the nice grips on the bottom four corners so it doesn't wiggle around. The one con is that the glass does get grimy easily but I just wipe it down once a week or so when I wipe down my bathroom mirror. It's also pretty durable, I've dropped it on tile a few times and no harm so far!"},

And then another.  The scale is stepped on only about once per day and in less than a year and a half, it has gone through at least 6 pairs of AAA batteries.  It's a waste that has nothing to do with the age of the batteries (brand new) or the brand of batteries (different brands). The only constant is this shockingly inefficient scale.  Something's definitely wrong with it and we will be replacing soon."},

They were not accurate-would literally fluctuate a couple pounds within weighing a couple of seconds within each other. And while I do not just want to bash other products...the point is, is that this scale delivers consistently and one does not have to worry about accuracy ever. Very happy with my purchase and anyone looking for a scale to do what it is supposed to do-weigh you. This is the product."},

This scale is highly recommended."},

The design is elegant, is not heavy at all, the price is reasonable for what you're getting and the fact that it is digital helps to pin-point your weight with precision. Of course, because it is a digital scale you'll need a pair of AAA batteries, but the first pair will come with the scale. On the downside, because of the digital nature of the scale, if you try to use it in a uneven floor (like carpet) your weight is going to be inaccurately calculated, so it is imperative to use this scale on tile."},

A cheap paper towel just won't get it in our home because if you have ever picked up a wet fur ball with a cheap paper towel, well, it's not pleasant.. We have used Brawny for as long as I can remember.  Sometimes, when another brand is on sale I'll get it, but always go back to Brawny. I love the Pick-A-Size because it saves so much waste in using a big paper towel to wipe up a small item on the counter or wherever. These are soft and more absorbent and I love them for wiping out the stainless steel kitchen sink after doing the dishes.  One towel will do both sides and the faucet.. And, for dusting!  I use a damp one to run over the counter and shelves and we have Tiffany style glass lampshades that love to catch and hold on to cat fur in the air.  A damp towel and it's gone :). When I got these towels I was using a generic store brand and sometimes it would take 3 or 4 to do a job, whereas it would take 1 with the Brawny so cost wise I save money using them because I use so many, but not  as many as I would with a cheaper, less absorbent brand."},

As one will read in the description, it feels like terry cloth on the sleeping side and a very smooth vinyl (almost like a tablecloth with the same protection) on the mattress side.  It also fits the mattress very well with no slipping or pulling to fit.  VERY PLEASED!!"},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Used on Amerisleep memory foam mattress", "review_body": "Did research prior to purchasing and this was recommended for memory foam mattresses as most absorbent & quiet. I do not have any other mattress protector to compare to, but it does seem very thin and relatively quiet. It does take away from the soft texture of our memory foam mattress (amerisleep S4), but I doubt there's a better option. We don't have a mattress pad (don't need once our mattress is so soft and don't want to take away from the feel anymore), so we lay right on the mattress pad. It does take away from softness slightly and the noise sounds like a track suite pants from the 90's rubbing together. You get used to it. Overall, good product. Haven't tested its absorbency yet, but I do have a dog with occasional incontinence so knew we had to get something.  I wish the top layer was softer, it feels like a cheap quality wash rag"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "So good I bought another one", "review_body": "Just upgraded to a bigger bed, so I needed to buy a new mattress pad. I have used the queen size version on my previous mattress without any problems so I bought the same one in a larger size. This is a thin mattress pad, so if you're looking for some extra cushion, look elsewhere. We have 2 little kids so we wanted something to protect our mattress from the occasional illness or accident. After one washing (following manufacturer guidelines) I tested the waterproofing by pouring a little water on top. The water beaded off the terry cloth top but soaked in, but the waterproof material layer kept the mattress and my hand dry. The edges of the pad are a different material and I didn't test if it was waterproof. The pad is quiet when you move, unlike some waterproof mattress pads. It make the bed slightly warmer, but not enough to make it uncomfortable. This mattress pad gives me piece of mind when my kids come in to snuggle. I would definitely recommend to others."},

I had become dissatisfied with my high-end, high-priced mattress protector made of thick \"breathable bamboo\" which was supposed to provide cooler \"more airy\" sleeping.  It didn't, but the real problem was it was so thick it would not fit in my high capacity front load washing machine.  After a while I became disgusted with the fact that I couldn't wash it, so began the search for another.  This meets all my requirements:  waterproof, hypoallergenic, comfortable, and easily washable.  It is basic but well-made...all I really need.  If you are looking for thick and plush this is not for you.  But I learned my lesson -- thick and plush means you can't possibly launder it."},

We have a new pillow top mattress & I do not want it to get damaged by coffee spills, body sweat smells, three little dogs sleep on the bed & definitely do not want doggy odors to seep through to the mattress. The mattress pad was laundered before using the first use.  Took forever to dry in my extra large dryer.  I missed the instructions on putting a towel in the dryer with it.  It would not dry on low heat after two hours & finally put it over shower rod to finish drying.  One of the things I really like about this mattress pad as compared to other waterproof type mattress pads is that it is soft & flexable & not crackly sounding.  The top is a terry cloth fabric.  I wish the sides were also waterproof too.  One of the problems with waterproof mattress pads is they do not breathe......my husband is always hot even though I have put two regular mattress pads on top of this waterproof pad and a quilt, he still is hot....I am not...I am just fine :)  So far quite pleased with the pad.  Will do an update next time I launder it & use a towel in the dryer per the instructions :)"},

Despite my initial concerns I threw it in the wash to discover that it holds a good amount of water.  After an extra spin cycle and a trip through the dryer it was still quite noisy but lacking an alternative I put it on the bed anyways.  Once on there's no noise, it's super thin so you hardly notice it's there - until you drop a cup of coffee onto the bed after tripping over a cat.  OOPS!  Worried about the brand new Tuft & Needle bed I'd just bought I hurriedly removed all of the linens to find my new mattress as perfect as the day I'd gotten it.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great mattress cover at a reasonable price!", "review_body": "UPDATE 12/7/15: Below is my original review for context. I have now had this cover for almost half a year and feel confident in saying I'm still happy with the product quality and the price. The main reason for getting this cover is because we have a dog that every now and then goes in the house, usually only when really anxious. I bought a nice but pricey mattress that I want to last for years, and didn't want to take chances. I believe the dog wet the bed once since we've had the cover, and it did not leak onto the mattress. We have washed the cover two or three times and haven't had any issues getting it dry in our old, cheap dryer. Still no noise, no problems with fit, no changing the way the mattress feels. I wish I had purchased this mattress cover last time I bought a mattress.. Original review:. This isn't the most thorough review as I've only had this mattress cover for a few weeks (no spills yet, thankfully!), but I wanted to give my initial impressions. I have faith that this mattress is hypoallergenic, waterproof, and everything else it claims. A 10 year warranty is better than I would have expected.. What I can say for certain is this cover doesn't alter the feel of the mattress, which is one of my largest issues with waterproof covers (or any bed cover). We just got a nice new mattress that feels amazing, and this cover doesn't change that! It doesn't make noise when you move, and it fits snug to a standard mattress size--no excess fabric, and no tight stretching (like my last mattress/cover combo). It also seems very well made and had no odor. The price was great and I look forward to not worrying about it being stuck if anything happens during the 10 year warranty period."},

Well, I have been sleeping on it, with another thin pad between it and my sheets which has helped me stay cooler at night. Yesterday morning I woke up with a young child in my bed and it was soaked! Yep, he had an accident on my 6 month old mattress. I panicked as I stripped the bedding from it and could not believe when I got it all off. The mattress was bone dry! I am very impressed! We are done with the diaper stage , so this was more than just a leaking diaper. He outright had an accident, but this mattress protector lived up to what it said and kept my mattress dry! I am very pleased!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Always use protection~", "review_body": "Great mattress protector. I just bought an all foam mattress from Tuft & Needle and this is one of the protectors they recommend on their website. It fits perfectly! Snug all around. It did feel a little \"plasticy\" right out of the package, and even after I washed it. But when it's actually fit over your mattress and you put a sheet over it, you'd have no idea. The top of the protector is terry cloth so no worries about it feeling funny under your sheets.. If you need a hidden barrier to protect your mattress from adult activities, this is the one!"},

It fit our extra deep king size mattress beautifully, hasn't shifted or bunched or made rustling noises AND it resists accidents leaking into the mattress. All at a fair price: well done!"},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Sleek, elegant, and accurate body weight scale", "review_body": "We received this scale about 2 weeks ago and so far have been very pleased with it.  It is slim, sleek and elegant; nice enough not to have to hide it when company comes over.  The readings are accurate as long as you start at zero.  If it doesn't reset to zero, simply step on the center until it recalibrates itself (we've only had to do this once because someone stepped on the scale before the previous reading had cleared).  We bought this for 3 reasons: 1) the numbers are large; 2) the backlight makes it even easier to read; and 3) the display stays on for several seconds after you step off of the scale.  This feature is convenient for writing down your exact weight.. We've only weighed people because that was the intent of this purchase.  But we highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a precision body weight scale with large, backlit numbers.  In fact we are so pleased with it that we just ordered a digital food scale from the same company (Etekcity Digital Food Scale and Multifunction Kitchen Weight Scale with Removable Bowl, 11 lb 5kg) and will write a review on that scale after we've had a chance to use it."},

I hold them and step on the scale and subtract my weight.  I am very pleased with this scale.We use it on dogs from 25 to 175 lb.  Lifting a 175 lb doggie will put a little strain on your back, but it is doable.  We needed this inexpensive scale pretty bad. It is necessary to be very still for the digital readout to lock on.  Standing by oneself is not a problem unless you have been drinking, holding a large moving dog is much more of a challenge, but it can be done.  For what it is and what it does, I have to give it 5 stars."},

A lot of reviews seem to indicate that it is delicate or prone to shattering, but I haven't had any problems with it so far.  The scale has a nice heft to it, and feels sturdy when you step onto it.  I'm not a huge fan of the fact you have to step on, off, and back on again to get a reading, but every reading is the same and accurate.  I'm not sure if others have gotten defective scales, but mine does what it needs to do, does it well, and looks good while doing it."},

Since I don't have a second scale I cant compare for accuracy, so Ill just assume that its accurate.  The design in sleek and the construction is solid.  The size of the top plate is large enough that my feet fit completely on top.  The price was better than a local department store."},

It's fine for that task, but if you are buying this for measuring your own weight, find another scale. For monitoring your own weight to see if a diet is effective, whether to lose weight, gain weight, or maintain weight, you need a scale that gives reproducible results. This is not that scale."},

I thought it was a battery issue so I replaced the batteries, and to my surprise it didn't help anything. After a few times I could only see the numbers from a very deep angle with my head almost on the floor. Go to weigh myself this morning and the screen is completely blue, I can't see any hint of numbers from any angle. Kind of a bummer. Guess they weren't kidding about the 1 year waranty. Kinda crap though.. Works great so far, seems to give accurate results multiple times in the same spot. I have uneven wooden floors (thanks 1930s NYC apt) but when I found a good flat spot to put it on, it worked perfectly! I always weigh in that specific spot now to get consistent results. Didn't realize the display screen lit up, so was pleasantly surprised! All I wanted was a basic digital scale for a good price and this hit the spot."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Perfect!", "review_body": "I love this scale. I weigh myself in the morning before I eat breakfast and after I go to the bathroom for an accurate reading for my weight. It's consistent every time and I would lose a little more weekly. The lighting is perfect even in the night time. I would put the scale on the tile as the carpet floor wouldn't give an accurate reading for the scale. This, plus a body fat monitor or skinfold caliper would be a perfect combo towards the weight loss journey. While the scale would tell you your weight were you to weigh yourself in the morning, it wouldn't tell you if you were bloated and/or what not.. It's thin and easy storage, it doesn't take up much room either."},

If you were getting the 24 Giant rolls on Subscribe & Save, you may want to go elsewhere for them; Amazon converted my order to these Giant rolls and I would be paying almost the same amount for approximately 4+ ROLLS LESS!  This isn't Amazon's fault, it lies solely on the manufacturer of Brawny.  I don't like the bait and switch with promises of giving me more.  Plus, I couldn't find any information about sheet counts on Brawny's website; instead I had to rely on customer images.. Old Giant Rolls: 117 sheets per roll x 24 rolls = 2,808 sheets total. New XL Rolls: 140 sheet per roll x 16 rolls = 2,240 sheets total. 568 sheets LESS!. I'll be shopping for another brand."},

This mattress pad gave a me a small, easily transportable solution.  Keep in mind this pad is very thin, so it will not provide any cushioning.

You see, he does this to communicate to me that his litter box needs attention.  I have a physical disability and hire someone to change the litter box as I can't get to it.  We'll if this person missed one day (they can't work 365 days a year ya know) Rambo would \"talk\" to me the only way he knew how - by leaving me a present on my bed. This would require through cleaning and disinfecting.. I resolved the problem, at least for now, with Rambo not urinating on my bed.  I simply put twice as much litter in the box.  That gives me two days with the litterbox.  I also had the litterbox placed where I could physically get to it  I did this after I ordered the SafeRest product.  I went ahead and put it on, just in case.. At this time I cannot review the product based on how it works, I can only review it on the following:. 1.

We---Ordered six lighted panels and ALL worked beautifully without a single issue. Shipping was super fast and packed exceedingly well. We hung these behind lace curtains on diner restaurant windows, lace curtains purchased here on Amazon that also were super stunning for the price. Seriously. If you hang these lights across the top first then let down each strand separate one at a time, you will have no problem. Afterwards we just rolled across the top and lay the long grouped strands one curtain panel at a time on a table cloth and wrapped the length by rolling them in the cloth to easily transport and move to our home gazebo! Again no issues. They continue to dazzle us. Full lights all twinkle functions work. The LED bulbs are tiny but the glow amazing!!!!! Really like stars twinkling---really! You do not have to hesitate to buy. I am so glad we tried even after reading negative reviews--these lights made the photos of our party beyond beautiful--romantic and cozy! We would give more than five stars if we could! Even if they just worked that one special night for our 25th Wedding Anniversary the price is well worth it--still we are enjoying them weeks later outside under covered porch and gazebo. If they stop, we would just order more--- they are THAT wonderful! See for yourself in our photos-----how utterly lovely these are, EVERYONE remarked how stunning and we did it ourselves..........THANK YOU for making and selling these lighted strands in curtain form!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They were just as pretty----- without the lace curtains you should know!!! The look like star light. ~Sarasota Florida"},

It zeros itself so you do not need to do anything even if you pick it up and move it! I work at a doctors office and I weighed myself this morning, it was extremely accurate! I\u2019m very impressed!

I tried to trick the scale in a series of experiments designed to reveal if the scale was using \"memory tricks\".

I was able to get different readings after varying the load only 4-6 tenths of a pound. Further, adding combinations of several known weights resulted in very consistent readings. Thanks for not building a device that uses psychology to trick users. Would buy again."},

There's all kinds of marketing messages about how these rolls are so much bigger than other rolls, and they are trying to make it seem like such a great value, but the old product was a much better deal.

Since these are supposed to be better, I bought a 2 pack at the same time as the dispenser. However, I waited until the standard filter was exhausted, and Amazon's return window has closed, to swap in one of these blue ones.  Well, I guess I should have read the other reviews first.  Sure enough.  They do not fit. They do not stay snug and secured in the dispenser. They pop up with force and gusto. I took the blue one out and put the standard back in and was able to get it to reseat just fine. Tried the blue one again, and it kept popping up. This is ludicrous. I paid way too much for these things for them not to fit.  I could have gotten 5-6 standard filters for the price of 2 longlast and yet 6 standard filters would theoretically last for 18 months while 2 longlast only last for 12 months. That is a poor return on investment. I think Brita or Amazon owes me some standard filters. In the meantime, I'll not buy these again and I suggest no one else do so either."},

I don't know if all scales are like this, but there is one thing I wanted to mention. The instructions say the scale should only be stored horizontally. This surprised me as I had planned to store it on its side in the closet. I just keep it under my couch instead though."},

It is super simple to use to, I don\u2019t like the gimmicky ones with body fat estimation because it\u2019s never going to be accurate enough to rely on. I have not tested the accuracy of the scale but based off of consistency it seems to be accurate, I haven\u2019t noticed any odd flucuations.

I thought it would break, as it is thin glass, but it wasn't a problem for this scale.  The scale measures weight very quickly, however, it does not give consistent weight each time.  After weighting myself and others, several times in a row, it is different each time, within 5 ounces.  Its not too big of a difference, so I'll keep it, but some may have an issue with it.  It also shows footprints, so will need to wipe it often to keep it looking shiny new."},

I have lost 10# and have seen my weight fluctuate up and down, both in am and pm. Plus the weight at night varies from the am wt. The problem is that the scale has certain weights that it likes, down the the tenth and what ever the actual weight is, it will select one of the specific weights it likes. Therefore what I see is an approximation of my weight, probably within 1/2 pound. If I were to list all (approx 80) of the weights I have recorded you would see many repeats of the same exact numbers. I get only one reading per whole number, like 184.2.. My very old \"spring\" scale is actually more accurate (if I could read it to a tenth of a pound\"."},

What is most impressive about this cover is that it is waterproof, but doesn't have that crinkly, plastic feel of other waterproof items. The cover was soft right out of the package. The top has a terry cloth-like feel and the pockets are deep enough to fit on my non-pillow top mattress. After washing, I put this immediately over my mattress, then topped it with my usual mattress cover, which has a little extra padding. My husband and I got a good night's sleep and didn't notice the addition of the new cover. Time will tell if the item alleviates allergy symptoms."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "GREAT BUY!!!!", "review_body": "Well I must say that this was beyond my expectations, I came in the time promised, the packaging was very good, it really does not change the feel of my mattress, the material is soft the edges are very stretchy so that is hugs the entire mattress, I actually thought it would just fit like the top half of my mattress like my sheets does but this is not the case it actually fits the whole width and even goes under the mattress, does not cover the entire bottom not that that's gonna be a problem. I have a full size therapeutic backsense mattress by the way and I think if it was a little bigger this cover would still fit because of the stretchy material on the sides. So the big question is does it really protect from liquid, well I just got mine today so i'm not 100% sure but i did try wetting the corner just a little with water and so far so good not leaks no wetness on the other side so I strongly believe that it would protect from other stuff such a bed wetting, (which by the way was the reason I got this, I have a 4 yr old son that never stays in his room and sometimes he has accidents during the night.) I will surely come back and maybe update this review as time goes to tell you guys more about when I wash it and stuff, if for some reason you really wanna get this now there are a lot of other helpful reviews which helped me decide if to get this or not.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "WHY and WHO should buy it?? 6 months UPDATE.", "review_body": "Instant pot aaah .. Finally I have it. I have heard people literally praising it as the best thing they ever owned, best gift ever received, best kitchen appliance ever etc etc. So Finally I spent my fair share to own this appliance at the time of thanksgiving sale.. CLARIFICATIONS :. 1. It is an electric pressure cooker and no magic involved.. 2. You can cook multiple items in it ( which you can also do in a regular stove top pressure cooker by stacking vessels- my mom used to do it all the time , so when ppl say you can cook multiple items in the IP as if it is a new thing - no it is just \"re-inventing the Cycle\".. 3. It cooks rice in less than 4 minutes( sometimes even in less amount of time) - yes it does but BUILDING UP THE PRESSURE takes some time around 8 to 10 minutes( sometimes even more than that for very big quantities of food). So total time is almost same(give or take) when compared to stove top pressure cooker.. WHY and WHO should buy it??. 1. For stove top pressure cooking , you need to monitor continuosly for whistles, and turning off the stove - This you can avoid in Instant pot..   Since it is electric pressure cooker with built in settings, it will automatically turn off the cooking for you , so you dont have to stand near by the.   stove all the time. NO BABY SITTING.. 2. So many BUILT IN functions : There are so many functions you can use for multiple cooking , some of them are Yogurt mode to make yogurt ,.   Rice mode for rice,  Slow cook mode etc.. 3. Manually you can adjust time and pressure as well. Great for people who want to experiment in their cooking to find out the fastest times for.   their cooking , which saves lot of time than to use preset functions.. 4. Delayed timer , which means turn on the delayed timer in the morning and by the time you come from office you have fresh piping hot.   homemade food ready to devour - PURE BLISS. 5. STAINLESS STEEL inner pot - NO TOXINS, NONSTICK COATINGS, NASTY CHEMICALS etc in your food.. 6. Safety : UL and ULC certified with 10 proven safety mechanisms. 7. Highly energy efficient and kitchen friendly - Less Electric bills.. 8. ONE POT COOKING ( multiple , if cooking multiple dishes by stacking) so less clean up. and so many more.... SO PEOPLE who are looking for stainless steel cooking pot, cooking multiple items at once, dont want to stand in front of the stove baby sitting , busy parents, who wants fresh homemade food with less efforts, One pot cooking, Bulk cooking .... etc etc ... YOU MUST BUY THIS.. CONS : So far none but it is OVERLY OVERRATED ( I agree it is very useful , I am in love with it but there is no MAGIC involved . As there is no.   BABY SITTING involved people love it so much they over rate it. * I myself love it , so don't get me wrong *. PRICE : At thanksgiving I got it for arounf $85 including a protection plan .. Regular price varies but it is around $120. Honestly it is a very good.   INVESTMENT and would buy it for $120 if I was unable to grab it for the sale price.. PROTECTION PLAN : YAY or NAY ?? I took it as it was only $10 for 4 years .. If you have kids, or you drop things frequently etc better take it.   Better safe than SORRY right?? You can always sleep peacefully.. DO YOU NEED TO BUY ADDITIONAL RECIPE BOOKS ?? If you are an experimental person and have a lot of time in Kitchen - answer is NO ,.   You are better off with joining a Facebook group to find interesting recipes. But if you are busy , dont want to trial and error then yes buy.   couple of ebooks for quick cooking , ofcourse you can join facebook groups as well , since it is totally free :). VERDICT :  Awesome features , Very well built appliance and consistently improving for every new model. Perfect for almost every cooking need.. * DONT GET DISHEARTENED if your recipes failed when you started using it.. It happens to everyone .. it takes time and some trial and error to get the exact recipe timings to your taste and texture. Everyone who bought this has been through that phase , so give sometime and try :). 6 month UPDATE :. 1. Clean up is a breeze , the stainless steel is almost like non stick and doesn't need lot of scrubbing.. 2. I do like to cook 2 things at a time and never tried 3 at a time as I am little afraid that some how they might get spilled while boiling and cooking. 3. Saves time, one pot to clean , so my cooking time on stove is greatly reduced.. 4. I have a guilty secret to share, I rarely clean the lid .. it never gets dirty or smelly so I am too lazy to clean it lol .. but I clean once a month or whenever I see splatters of food.. 5. For tough stains, pour baking soda, vinegar, dish soap or essential oils into the pot, put the lid and do manual 2 mins. All the stains and stuck food easily comes off and it is a SPA day for your IP.. 6. Now there are NEWER models available, cant wait to get them ( not sure when ).. 7. So far I LOVE it and no regrets.. [...], as I write clear, concise reviews to help people to make a decision."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I LOVE My Instant Pot!  But Here's What I Wish I'd Known when I First Got It", "review_body": "I LOVE my Instant Pot!  But I will be the first to admit that it can be a little intimidating at first, and it can feel like it has a steep learning curve (and I'm a tech reviewer and tech lawyer, and one of those people who generally just jumps in and figures things out without reading the manuals (\"Manuals? We don't need no stinkin' manuals!\"), so for me to feel like I'm not 'getting' something ..well,  yeah.  So if you are feeling a little bewildered by your new Instant Pot, *you're not alone*!)  Plus, the manual does *not* include certain information that I, at least, was looking for.  Such as, how long is each pre-programmed cooking cycle?  Exactly what temperature do the various saut\u00e9 settings heat to?  Things like that.. So, here are a few tips that have really helped me to finally 'get' it, plus instructions for two things that you can make in your Instant Pot that will change your life:  incredibly easy perfectly poached eggs in 2-3 minutes, and baked potatoes in 12 minutes.. First, it is almost impossible to mess up with this thing to a point of being dangerous, so if you're concerned about the exploding pressure cookers of yore, you needn't be (I said \"almost\", don't go overriding your pot's safety features and then blame me when you poke an eye out).  The lid audibly tells you when its sealed (when you turn it clockwise), and the pot won't even build up much pressure if you haven't properly closed the steam release handle by turning it, too, clockwise.  The most likely point at which a problem could arise would be if you try to open the lid (by turning it counter-clockwise) before all of the pressure has been released and normalized (so don't do that).  The pot visually lets you know when it's safe to open the pot, by the float valve (the little silver post that pops up when the pot is pressurized) dropping back down flush with the lid instead of being popped up.  Think of the float valve as the reverse of a turkey pop-up button, in the case of the float valve it's done when the button pops *in*, instead of out.. The saut\u00e9 function has three temperature settings:  'Normal' heats to 320 degrees, 'More' heats to 338 degrees, and 'Less' heats to 221 degrees (all in Fahrenheit). For pressure cooking, you will probably use 'manual' nearly all the time (nearly every Instant Pot cookbook I've read relies on the manual setting almost exclusively).  So *don't* feel badly for not using all of those other buttons very much, if at all (I've never used any of the preprogrammed buttons).. The preprogrammed settings each have their own timing, and *variable* pressure, which the pot manipulates by manipulating the temperature of the contents (the higher the temperature, the higher the pressure).  That is primarily what makes them different from manual, which provides one consistent pressure (either high or low).  However they *generally* bring the contents to high pressure, fluctuating the temperature a little so that the pressure fluctuates a little too, for a set period of time (the main exceptions to this are the rice button, and the multigrain button).  Personally I just find it easier to use 'manual' and set the time that I want.. After you hit 'manual' to start cooking, you then set the amount of time you want it to cook at pressure, after which you will have a 10-second grace period (for example to add more time, etc.), after which the display will switch to displaying the word \"on\".  Then it will be a while before the display switches to the timer countdown.  This is *normal*.  The amount of time you enter is for how long it will cook *after it reaches full pressure* (either high or low pressure, depending on what you selected), and so the timer will switch on when it reaches full pressure.. The cooking time in any recipe is the time *at full pressure*, not in total.  So you need to take into account the time it will take to reach full pressure (which depends on many variables, including what is in the contents of the pot, what temperature they started at, and your altitude), *and* how long it will take for the pressure to be released and normalized (i.e. for the float valve to pop in, which of course is really \"dropping in\", but you get the point).  And this brings us to the two different types of pressure release.. All Instant Pot recipes will include (or *should* include) either one of these terms:  natural pressure release (also known as NPR), or quick pressure release (QPR or QR).  What these mean is simply either \"let the pressure dissipate on its own\" (natural pressure release), or \"force the pressure to escape immediately by turning the steam release handle counter-clockwise to the open position (quick release).  The reason for using quick release (QR) is not because you are too impatient to wait for natural release, but because your food will be over cooked if you don't get it the heck out of dodge once it's done cooking at pressure.  A really good example of a food needing quick release is poached eggs (which come out *perfectly* in the Instant Pot (see how to poach eggs in the Instant Pot below)).  On the other hand, lots of (if not most) foods need the natural release - it's part of their cooking process and processing time.. Natural pressure release generally takes between 15 and 20 minutes.. Quick pressure release takes about a minute, plus the hours spent in the ER if you forget to KEEP YOUR HANDS, FACE, AND ALL OTHER BODY PARTS AWAY FROM THE STEAM VALVE WHEN YOU DO IT!!  Many people put a towel over the valve before they turn it, to help suppress the steam, which you may want to do (I don't because then I just end up with a scalding hot towel - but I also rarely need to do QR, and those times that I do, I'm sufficiently respectful of the power and heat of that steam to keep my distance).. Finally, in my experience, unless you are doing a \"dump everything in at once and turn it on\" recipe, you will definitely want to have all of your ingredients ready to go before you start cooking.  For example, for any recipe that includes saut\u00e9ing in the pot first, then adding ingredients and then starting pressure cooking, you definitely want to have everything lined up before you start.. Oh, wait, *this* is actually the final note:  the stainless steel inner pot can take a real beating, and cleans up just fine..BUT...after the first use or so (it was after my first use) you will see little \"stains\" (not sure what else to call them) and, if you are anything like me, you will think \"Oh no! I have ruined the beauty of this pot! How can I fix it?\" It turns out that this is *very* normal (at least the 'staining', not sure about my reaction being normal :-) ). In my case I had made beans, and my pot now still bears the \"imprints\" of beans, even though it is completely clean..it's sort of like the chalk outlines from a little bean murder scene. ;-) I'm in an Instant Pot forum on Facebook where many IP cookbook authors are members (including JL Fields and Jill Nussinow) and they have all said that this is perfectly normal and just what happens (in fact they said it in response to my \"Oh no, I've ruined my beautiful pot\" post).. Ok, I think that those are about all of the things that I had wished that I had fully understood on my first day with my Instant Pot.. Oh, actually there's one more thing.  I didn't fully appreciate, until several days in, just how amazing this aspect of the Instant Pot is: you can start something cooking in it, and then *walk away* - even leave the house, and it will finish cooking just like you instructed, and be *perfectly done*, and then it will *keep it warm for up to 10 hours*!  Not keep cooking it, just *keep it warm*.  For up to 10 hours!  You can put something in there in the morning, leave for the day, and come back to a perfectly cooked whatever, just waiting for you!  Booyah!  (I think this is the thing that pressure cooker purists who try to talk people out of getting an Instant Pot, rather than a stovetop pressure cooker, fail to understand.  You can't just walk away from a stovetop pressure cooker after the stuff starts cooking.). Now, here are the *the best* accessories (in my opinion) that you will want for your Instant Pot.. You definitely will want\u00a0. \u00a0for your Instant Pot (the Instant Pot comes with a little steaming trivet, but this steamer basket is *way* more useful - in fact it's how you make both poached eggs and baked potatoes).  Actually you will want *a* steamer basket, but trust me, this is the one you want, both because of the big handle, the fact that the handle telescopes, and, most importantly, you can use it with or without the little legs flipped down, and when you flip the little legs down, they give you plenty of space for as much water for steaming as you could ever need without worrying about the water touching the food that's in the basket.. Or, instead of, or in addition to, the above steamer, you can get\u00a0. .  The legs on this trivet are an inch and a half high (the rack that comes with your Instant Pot only gives 3/4 of an inch of clearance). and the flat-bottomed steamer is very versatile.. Personally, I have both, as they each serve their own purpose, and the trivet that comes with the set is really useful for pot-in-pot cooking, at which you may also want to try  your hand.  Pot-in-pot (or \"PIP\") is where you put a second, smaller vessel inside your Instant Pot's main internal pot.  There are different reasons for doing this, ranging from \"I only want to cook a small amount of something like oatmeal\" to \"I want to cook a cheesecake in my Instant Pot\" to \"I want to cook two different things at the same time in my Instant Pot (like cooking beans, and having a bowl of rice on a trivet (see why you want a good trivet?) above the beans, steam cooking at the same time).. For pot-in-pot cooking, I recommend any stainless steel vessel that is no greater in diameter than 7.5 inches, and no taller than 4 or so inches (your internal pot has a diameter of just over 8.5 inches and a height of about 6 inches).  Lots of people use glass vessels such as Pyrex or Corningware, but I personally prefer to use stainless steel because if you drop it you'll just have a mess, rather than a mess plus broken glass.. If you're really keen on making cheesecakes, steamed puddings, flans, and that sort of thing in your Instant Pot, you may also want to grab this  stainless steel\u00a0. , which includes two stacking pans. and a rack to set them on which has handles that close up over the pans to secure them.. You will also want this separate\u00a0. \u00a0that is sold by the Instant Pot people.  This lid fits on your *inner metal pot*, and this way when you are using your Instant Pot for *non-pressurized* cooking, such as when using it as a slow cooker, or with the saut\u00e9 function, you will be able to see what is going on in there.  Basically, in these usages, you can think of your Instant Pot as a counter-top stove burner (albeit one with really cool bells and whistles) - that may help you to understand why you want a (see-through!) lid for that inner pot.  Plus, once you are done cooking in any mode, you can use the inner pot to store the leftovers in your fridge, and use this lid to cover it.. In terms of Instant Pot cookbooks to get you started, they are a relatively new genre, and a *lot* of them are only available as Kindle or other digital format books.  Personally, I like to have a physical book when it comes to cookbooks, and so I like this one...you can't go wrong with America's Test Kitchen cookbooks, and their pressure cooker cookbook is no exception:. I also happen to be a strict vegetarian, and for vegetarian and vegan Instant Pot cooking, this book by J.L. Fields is considered the best book out there (it's pretty darned good!):. And if you also are vegetarian or vegan, you'll appreciate the recipes in this one:. ..and this one:. And speaking of recipes - here is how to make those poached eggs, and baked potatoes.. Poached Eggs:  Lightly grease 1 to 4 (depending on how many poached eggs you want) Pyrex custard cups with butter or oil.  Put a cup of water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, put a steamer basket or trivet in the pot (making sure that the water doesn't come over the top), and set your Pyrex cups in the steamer basket or on the trivet. I use my Oxo steamer basket for this, and I love that when they are done I can just grab the handle and pull the whole shebang out (remember the handle will be HOT, be sure to wear an oven mitt).  Use Manual setting, low pressure, for 2 to 3 minutes.  2 minutes will probably be enough unless you're at a high altitude.. Baked Potatoes:  Remember how I said you could make baked potatoes in 12 minutes?  And remember how I said that the recipe times are for the time *at pressure*? ;~)  Still, even given the time to come to pressure, and to have the pressure come back down, you can have perfectly steam-baked potatoes in under half an hour, and the best part  is that you can start them, and then *walk away*! When you are ready for your potatoes, they will be perfectly done and waiting for you, even if you have abandoned them for hours!  Just put water in the bottom of your Instant Pot, flip the legs down on your Oxo steamer, put the steamer in the pot and then dump your potatoes in on top of the steamer.  Using the Manual setting, set the cooking time for 12 minutes, using high pressure.  Then walk away!  Now, because these are 'steam baked' (i.e. cooked whole over steam, but not in water), the skins will not be crisp, but these are otherwise exactly like the baked potatoes you know and love - they're great with butter, sour cream, etc.!  This works with new potatoes, and regular potatoes!. Happy Instant Potting!"},

We had good luck with the first one and based on that experience purchased 4 additional cookers as gifts for family members. Two of the 4 gift units we purchased stopped working inside of 5 months and the manufacturer is not honoring the warranty. After having you jump through hoops sending electronic photos and receipts they assign a \"ticket number\" via an email that also says someone will be getting back to you. Except they never do no matter how many times you follow up. It's clear that their strategy is to simply ignore you until you give up and go away. With a few minutes research it easy to verify that there are hundreds of complaints regarding this company and their refusal to honor warranties. Wake up Amazon. Unethical companies should not be allowed to continue selling on your site."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Nearly two years later, what I\u2019ve learned", "review_body": "Updated: 9/26/2017. I\u2019ve had my Instant Pot (IP) going on two years; I bought it on Black Friday 2015. I am still as enthusiastic about it now as I was when I bought it, but I don\u2019t use it as much anymore. I use it a few times a week mainly for side dishes or one pot meals. I love it for steaming vegetables, easy peeling hard boiled eggs, creamy risotto, and it makes a mean mac\u2019n\u2019cheese!  Lots of one pot meals like chili, sausage and peppers, butter chicken, even ziti spaghetti.  Super for soups.  I love, love, love making an Olive Garden copycat Zuppa Toscana in it.. It\u2019s not Instant Cooking... it takes time to get to pressure, add the actual cooking time, and then a cool-down (or natural release) period.  Your recipe might state a cook time of 30 minutes but it doesn\u2019t mention the 10-20 minutes it takes to get to pressure and the 10-15 minutes it might need for a natural pressure release.  Be sure to factor that in so your family isn\u2019t waiting at the table 30 minutes before your dinner is ready.  You\u2019ll know what \u2018hangry\u2019 means then!. There is definitely a learning curve with this cooker. Pressure cooking is dependent on density \u2013 and you\u2019ll see that in the charts that the Instant Pot company has on it\u2019s website; something cut into chunks will cook faster than a big solid piece.  I think the hardest thing to learn to cook in the IP is meat. I pretty gave up on roasts.  It just takes practice and patience.. I recommend using recipes when you are learning how to use your IP. There are great free recipes online, some of my favorite websites are Pressure Cooking Today, This Old Gal, and Dad Cooks Dinner. Instant Pot also has a company sponsored Facebook group that posts recipes and is a good place to learn about your pot.. I love that I can cook pot-in-pot, in winter I put steel-cut oats with all my add-ins (raisins, vanilla, cinnamon, almond milk) into a small stainless-steel bowl, set that on the included trivet, throw a cup of water in the bottom of the IP, set it for 5 minutes manual pressure and then go get ready for work.  By the time I\u2019m done, it\u2019s cooked, depressurized, and so yummy.  Way easier to clean a little bowl too.  The recipe for that comes with the IP.. I rarely use my Instant Pot as a slow cooker, I have found that most everything I cooked in my slow cooker can be cooked at pressure. The pea soup I cooked all day in the slow cooker took an hour in the IP (15 min to come to pressure, 30 minutes on the Soup setting, 15 min natural release) and tasted just as good. I can do a corned beef in 90 minutes (plus that extra half hour I mentioned above).  If you do use it as a slow cooker, please know that the low setting on the IP is equivalent to \u2018stay warm\u2019 on your slow cooker. It also only heats from the bottom not the sides like a traditional slow cooker.  That hasn\u2019t seemed to make a difference from what I can tell though.. Now to some specific tips:. Getting the lid on properly: The instructions say to line up the arrows to get the lid aligned with the pot before you close it and seal the vent. The arrows are really hard to see and honestly, you don\u2019t need them. Don\u2019t bother painting them white like some folks suggest.  Instead, learn this: at the back of the Instant Pot is a black \u2018ledge\u2019 that the lid fits onto, the lid then slides to the right to close it. Put the lid on with the sealing mechanism at that point.  It will make sense when you start to use it. Look from above when you put the lid on and you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m talking about. Kind hard to explain, see the 3rd photo below.. Accessories: My sealing ring lasted nearly a year. Towards the end of the 10th month it had stretched out so much that the only way to have it stay inside the lid was to freeze it. Although it worked, it\u2019s not the best thing to do. I keep two rings on hand now, one for sweets and one for savory. The rings DO pick up odors and you don\u2019t want a green curry smell on your custard. They are relatively inexpensive so buy one with your IP order.. I use the\u00a0. \u00a0for a steamer basket. I did pry the riveted handles off but if I was to do it again I would bend them upwards in a vise. It\u2019s hard to get this basket out of the pot without handles. I bought a pot lifter (see last photo) but it didn\u2019t work well \u2013 it is designed to lift from the outside of a pot, not the inside.  Now I just put my silicone mitts on and pick the basket up.  That said, I am very happy with the basket. It can hold 5 lbs. of diced potatoes with a few raw eggs balanced on top (which by the way can be cooked together for 4 minutes on high pressure, quick release, for a great potato salad base\u2013 don\u2019t forget to put one cup of water into the bottom of the pot though).. I use these style silicone mitts when handling the inner pot.\u00a0. . The inner pot (stainless steel liner) spins when you stir food. I had tried binder clips to hold it in place when I stirred but it\u2019s just easier to hold the pot while wearing one of these. Lots of recipes call for stirring something in at the end, or sauteing something at the beginning, and the spinning is just annoying. As mentioned above, the mitts are great for taking the hot stainless-steel liner out of the pot. Highly recommend.. I resisted the lure of the cheesecake for about 10 months then I finally succumbed. Way too many pictures of IP cheesecakes on Facebook. Pretty much anything that can be cooked bain-marie style can be done in the IP (think custard, cr\u00e8me brulee).  I bought the\u00a0. \u00a0which works great. Some people like push pans. The only thing I can say about this is that a 6\u201d cheesecake has a few less calories than a 9\u201d one. The IP makes cheesecakes a breeze to cook. Beware.. Two last things 1) This cannot be used for canning. Electric pressure cookers do not come up to a high enough pressure to safely can food. They also don\u2019t maintain a steady heat, they have on/off heat cycles.  You need a stovetop pressure canner to be safe. 2) Don't be scared of this thing - it has lots of safety features. As long as you follow the directions you will be fine. Never force the lid off - it slides easily when pressure is gone. Open the lid away from you so any residual steam is blocked by the lid. Use common sense and you will be just fine!. This is a great purchase \u2013 you\u2019ll love it!"},

I live in a Sprinter van full-time and was using an induction burner for cooking, but since I've gotten this little gem, I haven't used the induction burner once!. This is so easy to use, and it's the perfect size for one or two people. I've been making a lot of stews, and I'll saute the onions, carrots, and meat (if I'm using meat) then add everything else, seal it, and set it for 7 minutes on high pressure. I let it release naturally and have a perfectly cooked, tasty meal every time. This gives me enough for 4 or 5 servings.. I also quick soaked beans the other day by covering them with water, hitting pressure for 5 min. then letting it release naturally and let it sit (not on keep warm) for a couple of hours.. I'll often make dinner right after I reheat my lunch, and make sure the keep warm function is on. I'm able to drive with it in my sink and have a hot, healthy, delicious meal waiting for me when I'm done driving.. I've even baked banana bread in it!!! So exciting, because I don't have an oven. It turned out SO good! I used one of the containers and the lid from my To-Go Ware stainless steel lunch container to bake it in on the rack.. Because this cooks so quickly, it is very easy on my solar system. I can reheat leftovers on saute in 4 minutes, and it's only drawing 67a while it's on.. I did have a VitaClay, that I absolutely loved for making beans, and especially bone broth, but it takes much longer to cook and is heavier. So, more battery drain, more storage space, and more weight as compared to the Instant Pot Mini and the Mini wins on each count!"},

Very sturdy if you do not over fill or make too heavy. I typically use two bags a week as we have two trash pick ups per week. So I cannot attest yet to whether the scent/odor protection lasts more than five days. We also keep our lid closed (as we have dogs and cats) so the scent stays trapped inside the canister.

I can confirm that this is definitely the case, it is extremely soft and there is no crunchy or unpleasant plastic feeling.  I can't comment how well it protects yet but after washing it I did notice that it did trap water in it, making me feel more comfortable with the level of protection it can provide.

While amply sized, it doesn't sag or bunch.  Best of all, it folds up into a much smaller bundle compared to our old mattress pads that were always a challenge to wash, dry, fold and store.

I mean if you dont even care about customers who genuinely bought your product ...then please clearly call it out on your packaging!. we dont want to buy your products anymore if you are not standing by it as per the gaurantee! I hope some from support looks at this and makes an attempt to reach out!"},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Review from a confirmed foodaholic", "review_body": "Over the years, I have purchased hundreds of items from Amazon, and for the most part, got what I expected.  I never reviewed any of them.  But from the moment I received my Instant Pot, I felt that I had purchased something that not only exceeded my expectations, but will make my life easier (and more delicious)!. I am a holistic nutritionist and a follower of a lower carb/paleo/primal lifestyle (and yes, it is not only a food regimen, but a lifestyle).  Many of the meals I prepare require advance planning and preparation, and I am OK with that, realizing that it is an investment in my family's health and wellbeing.  I was looking for something that would support my food choices and perhaps make it a little less time-consuming.  I have used a crockpot extensively over the past years and while I appreciate the ease of use and the ability to put a meal on the table soon after I got home in the evening, there is that \"everything tastes the same\" factor I was running into with my family.. So I began thinking about ways to cook my meals faster and realized that a pressure cooker may be the answer.  But, I am scared of pressure cookers.  Even though my head tells me that people have been using them for many years with no problems, my heart said there was a strong chance I could blow up the entire kitchen, myself included.  I had no idea there were electric, programmable pressure cookers out there that would virtually eliminate that worry until I began researching them, first on Amazon, and then on other websites.  I eventually purchased the Instant Pot over the others because of the stainless steel insert (no aluminum), the size of the pot (I wanted a larger capacity), and the ease of use.. The day it arrived, I plugged it in and began reading the manual.  The manual was very helpful, even included a suggested trial run to familiarize one with the basics.  My first meal was potato soup (I know potatoes are not low carb or paleo, but once in a while you gotta have potato soup).  I was amazed at how easy and delicious it was to make this soup that would normally take a couple of hours.  I just coarsely chopped the vegetables, threw those in the pot, added the seasonings and the liquid, started the pressure cooker option, and in 20 minutes all I had to do was use my immersion blender to puree the soup, add some cheese, stir and it was ready to eat.  AND the soup was every bit as good as my slower version that keeps me tied to the kitchen to stir and monitor until it's done.  That is the hidden beauty of this appliance, that while it's cooking your food, you are free to do other things such as harass your kids to get their homework done.  No more watching over a pot!. My second recipe was lemon pepper chicken wings.  There is a searing option, so first I browned the wings in a bit of butter, then added lemon pepper, salt, and 2 more tablespoons of butter.  Put on the lid, set the pressure cooker for 25 minutes, and out came the most delicious, fall-of-the-bone wings just loaded with flavor.  The family went wild!. I also made mushroom gravy (no flour) pork chops in 30 minutes in the pressure cooker - the gravy was so good my son ate in on top of some gluten free noodles the next day for lunch - and a breakfast meat loaf in the slow cooker, also a winner.. I am also using this to reheat food since we don't use the microwave anymore and I'm finding that it seems easier and makes less of a mess than going stovetop.. That's a pretty long review for a first-timer but I am so enthusiastic about this product that I just had to share."},

Fortunately it is covered by a one year warranty, unfortunately that means I have to deal with their less than stellar customer service and I am currently still stuck with the effective product. All in all, the product works well when it works. If you purchase their product make sure the first thing you do is go through and try every option on the product, it would be unfortunate to discover a defect once the warranty has expired.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Greatest asset in my kitchen", "review_body": "Update: On Prime Day of July 2016, I bought another one of these pressure cookers. So many times I have been in the middle of cooking and thought, boy would I really like another cooker! It got cumbersome pretty quickly having to empty the contents of one meal, cleaning the cooker, and then starting with another recipe for a side dish. Just thought I would update so that everyone knows how seriously awesome this machine is..  Background of my cooking experience: I received this when I was 23 years old last Christmas. I had this pressure cooker on my wishlist for almost a year because I couldn't afford or justify spending that much money on myself, especially because I did not know how well this would work out for me. I didn't start cooking until I was on my own in an apartment during college. About 6 years ago when my boyfriend would drive up to visit for the weekend, I realized I didn't know how to cook, and it was embarrassing. I made a great breakfast sandwich and a colorful salad for a couple more years before I took a dive into \"real\" cooking. For the next few years or so, my boyfriend would become my guinea pig for all the various, horrible meals I cooked, all so I could get more experience in the kitchen. Even though we're not together anymore, I like to think it wasn't because of what I put him through. I still wasn't as great at cooking as I wanted to be. That's where the pressure cooker came into play.. My mom bought me the cooker, the 6 quart size. She bought me a cookbook to go with it, the \"Electric Pressure Cooker: 365 Quick & Easy, One Pot, Pressure Cooker Recipes For Easy Meals.\" This book is ESSENTIAL to go with this cooker. A necessity. You hear me? ESSENTIAL. This is because the \"recipe book\" that goes with it is not good, and I haven't used it at all. You, the reader, deserve a REAL cookbook. If you're already splurging on this pressure cooker, you might as well make the purchase worth it by buying the cookbook too. However, some of the add-ons from the pressure cooker actually include helpful information about how long/what settings to use on certain kinds of foods. I have used that. It also lists in detail what kinds of foods the settings are used for.. This is now the end of June and I can honestly say that I have used this pressure cooker weekly, multiple times a week sometimes, and even daily (depending on my schedule). Thanks to the cookbook listed above, cooking blogs, and Pinterest, I have made some AMAZING, delicious, and FAST recipes out of this thing. I am continually amazed by this machine. This has made cooking so much easier, faster, and a lot more fun for me, so that I no longer feel like all that I do once I get home from work is slave over cooking for my household.. This is not to say that the pressure cooker is completely intuitive. You will probably need to read the manual to learn about the different functions and settings. This is a complex cooker, and in order to take full advantage of the many things this baby can do, you should read the manual. Just look at it, will ya.. Some of the few things I have made with this pressure cooker is honey BBQ wings for game nights (fall-off-the-bone wings that were finished in the broiler), BBQ bacon meatloaf (my fiance's favorite recipe, says it is better than his mom's-- take THAT, Kathy), sausage and cheese soup (tastes like the flavors have been cooking all day when in actuality it's just TEN, yes you read correctly, ten minutes), cheesy garlic potatoes, couscous, quinoa, salmon, baked potatoes, pan-seared porkchops (perfection in this thing!), bacon, pork taquitos, meatballs, risotto, Italian Zuppa Toscana soup, baked beans (and not from the can), casseroles, chowder, Hawaiian BBQ chicken, and more. This one device has allowed me to feel like a master chef that delivers exquisite meals. All of the recipes are cooked straight in the pressure cooker, because it has so many different settings like saute, brown, simmer, etc. This helps tremendously when it is time to clean up. A one-pot cooking monster machine.. Some helpful tips: The pressure cooker has to warm up / preheat when you set it to cook something. As you will find out when you read the manual, actually setting the timer will delay your preheating from starting by however long you set the timer (can be useful in cases when you have other things cooking and want them to be finished at the same time). To start your pressure cooker, you need to hit the \"manual\" button (this is what I use no matter what I cook), adjust your pressure with the \"adjust\" button (also used when you click the \"saute/browning\" button-- adjusting the pressure for the saute function is the difference between \"sauteing/browning\" [normal], \"thickening\" [\"less\" mode], \"stir-frying\" [\"high\" mode], and \"simmering\" [\"less\" mode]), and then waiting for the confirmation beep that will happen after you are done adjusting your settings. Be sure to close the steam release valve when you are cooking with the pressure cooker. This can be done by turning the steam release up. To do a \"quick release\" after your countdown is done, turn off the cooker and release the pressure by turning the steam release down (be careful not to hover your hand over this part as the steam will shoot out). You will know when it is safe to open the lid when the silver float valve drops, and actually, you will be literally unable to open it before it drops. When it comes to safety, and basically everything else, this pressure cooker is not the pressure cooker your grandma used. When I am doing a \"slow release\" of pressure, I of course first down off the cooker and then place a cold wash rag on top of my cooker until the float valve drops. It is normal to sometimes see puffs of steam come out of your cooker while it is cooking something. Also, my mom didnt notice the \"off\" button on the bottom right for a while, so whenever she had to switch between functions she would literally unplug the cooker and then plug it back in. This is not necessary.. The only thing I haven't tried making in this is yogurt, but I plan to make it some day and will update this review afterwards.. Clean-up is so easy. Take out the pot and let it soak for a while. Trust me, when you let your cooker soak for a day, the crusts and stains of food will come right up with a little elbow grease. Be sure to clean the lid and take out the transparent rubbery part from the inside of the lid. Don't forget to clean the outside of the cooker either, as food can sometimes get stuck in the lip of the cooker.. After raving about this cooker to my mom, she bought one for herself, and we share recipes and knowledge about how to use the cooker with each other. It's a fun thing we get to bond about. I've actually convinced some co-workers to get one too, in particular one co-worker who is a caretaker for a disabled family member. She told me that cooking for him and her own immediate family was exhausting, especially because, in cases where he is on his own, using the stove or oven is too dangerous for him. When you're able to throw ingredients for a soup into the pressure cooker, and 10 minutes later (not counting pre-heat time) you have a delicious soup for days, it can really take off some of that pressure for some people.. Some other things that I like about the pressure cooker is that these recipes do not require a lot of ingredients, and you will probably have most of them stocked in your kitchen already.. The only drawback that I have experienced is it is not very intuitive if you have not used it before. But the userguide is helpful, and if you have any questions, you can comment and let me know!. I've included some pictures. A go-to easy recipe for potlucks that everybody loves is: 1 cup of water, a bag of frozen fully cooked meatballs on the steamer basket and cook those for five minutes. Use a quick release and remove meatballs. Discard cooking water. Add 18 oz of BBQ sauce, 18 oz. of grape jelly, and stir frequently on tge \"saute\" setting until combined into a sauce. Add your meatballs back in and change the settings to \"keep warm.\" Voila. Sweet BBQ meatballs.. Pictures added show the bbq honey wings I made in the pressure cooker and then finished in the broiler. Other photo is bbq bacon meatloaf made in the cooker and then finished in the broiler. Last, the most amazing beef enchiladas--I cooked a 3 lb beef chuck roast in the pressure cooker and then rolled up the tortillas and finished in the oven. The last two pictures are from recipes found in the cookbook I listed. Happy cooking, everyone!"},

Did our research, decided on this Etekcity, ordered it off Amazon. It came in, we unpackaged it, set it up and, bam, there it was: totally awesome, clear and distinct numbers and registered perfect weight in seconds. Moreover, both my wife and I were concerned that the footprint would be a little too small for us - I am 6' and weight a little over 200 lbs, and my wife is 5'7\" and weren't sure if it was going to be too \"square\" instead of the rectangle of our old analogue.  Don't worry, it's totally perfect.. I appreciate excellent craftsmanship, excellent service, and excellent products (especially nowadays). Buy this dog. You won't regret it."},

This was the least expensive of the ones I've purchased.  I tested it's consistency by getting on and off several times in a short period.  It alway reported the same weight.  It gave the same weight as on my doctor's office's scale during an hour period.  I have old eyes and the numbers are very easy to read without having to move around to see them.  It was easy to get it started.  It's attractive, lightweight, and my bi-fold linen closet door moves easily over it."},

I have a new pitcher provided by Brita and the filter can fit and work well. However, after 4 months of use, the longlast filter started leaking out the internal materials slightly, and the dark dust/particles can be apparently found in the bottom of the pitcher or my cold water bottle. I still need to have a way to filter the faucet water, and so that now I use two filters. One longlast is inside the Brita pitcher, and another standard filter is inside the UltraMax dispenser. At least I didn't see any dark particles came out from the standard filter for recent many years. I replaced the longlast filter, but anyway, the water will be pouring to the UltraMax standard filter. I don't want to drink any dark particles in the water..  !! Stop using it before you double check if this filter can tightly fit and sit in your pitcher or dispenser!. This filter is poor designed and can result in leaking water from the filter seal ring gap because it cannot be tightly sealed in your pitcher. I'm not challenging the filter quality and water test certification it claimed, but the water leaked through filter seal ring is not filtered and may contaminate your filtered water. I own Brita UltraMax and it completely has no problem with original Brita filter replacement that can fit and seal tight and well. However, after replacing with Brita LongLast filter, the first thing I noticed is the water flow rate does not look like as slow as other posted comments. Then I figured out although I did use force and press firmly to insert the filter into the pitcher like what I did with original Brita filter, however, the LongLast filter just easily pops up without any external forces over and over again. Brita claims this filter can fit any Brita pitchers except Steam, so be careful and watch out loosen filter in your pitcher constantly to avoid spending much expensive money but just drink the unfiltered water.. I have bought two so I use another to check if this is just one filter faulty issue. However, the same issue happens to the second one. I'm wasting my money and cannot get clean water filtered."},

Excellent for shredded chicken (it just FALLS apart!). Cooking tip from experience:. Personally, I think their manual over estimates cooking times for vegetables. If I use their recommended cooking durations, a lot of times they turn to mush. For example: My personal ideal setting to lightly steam broccoli crowns is to use the \"Steam\" setting, set the timer to \"0\", then release pressure as soon as it's finished. This makes perfect broccoli that keeps the flowers in tact, and the stalks a pleasant \"al dente\" texture. This same setting works well for fresh cauliflower florets, keeping a nice firm texture but taking away the \"mealiness\" of raw cauliflower."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Bigger (8 qt) means more liquid required!!", "review_body": "I bought the 8 qt after doing a lot of research, but despite all my careful research there were some unexpected surprises. First, I was under the impression the only difference in the 6 and 8 was size. The 8 quart requires more water or liquid to reach pressure (2-2.5 cups vs. the 1-1.5 cups for the 6 qt)-- this can affect many recipes that call for only 1 cup of liquid! The 8 qt is really for cooking larger quantities, but I thought I could cook smaller portions in it too, and you can but, again, you have to add more liquid than some recipes require. You can get around this by doing PIP (pot in pot) cooking, but what a hassle if you want to sear or saut\u00e9 something--you would have to do that in the inner pot, then transfer everything to the PIP smaller pot (which you have to figure out what to use and buy it), you can then add the amount of liquid to your dish, and if it is not 2 cups, then you would add 1 cup of water to the inner pot itself, so, combined you have enough liquids to reach pressure. The 8 qt, because it holds more, takes longer to release pressure naturally (and maybe a little longer with quick release, too). It is a wonderful size, and I thought it would be versatile, allowing me to cook large or small portions, but I am cooking for two and this is just too big since it requires the extra liquid. I exchanged it for a Duo60 without doing anything more than the Pressure Test. Please note, I spoke with customer service at Instant Pot because the Manual says the Pressure Test natural release time would be 15 minutes and it took 55! They said the manual has a misprint, the \"3 mark\" should read 3rd mark, not the number 3 because the 3 is 3 liters and the 3rd Mark is 3 cups, so yes, big difference. I thought the pot was defective, so was glad I called. Very nice people!! I gave the 8qt 4 stars because it is a wonderful appliance, the -1 star was for not explaining the differences better so people can make a more informed decision on which size to buy. Gotta love the ease of returns on Amazon,"},

I was blown away to see high quality enamel around the top on the inside where you so often see teflon.. I had a very bad experience with the stainless pot (I don't know if it was the one that came with in the cooker or the spare I bought from same company) but the stainless steel pitted the first few uses and I had to exchange for a new one that has functioned without issue.. The irony is that I bought this because of the stainless steel.  I don't like using non-stick surfaces because they wear and you end up eating the teflon.  Now it appears I have eaten stainless steel instead!!. I expect this was a fluke and I expect to be happy with this product but I am disappointed that having now received the defective product and had a chance to assess the issue no one has contacted me to offer a refund.  As is clear in the photos... this was a major fail and who knows what has gotten into my system as a result."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Wish I got the 6QT instead of the 3QT", "review_body": "UPDATED - So I finally got the 6QT and oh. my. g... - so wonderful! Such a relief! I can cook 5 lbs of frozen chicken in ONE cycle and have food for my dog for the next week! Yay! And last night I finally made that famous \"soccer mom spaghetti\" (dump a box of pasta, one jar of sauce, a bag of frozen meatballs plus a jar of water in the pot then push a button) and - perfect. I made this same thing in the 3qt about a few times and it never came out right - first the pasta didn't cook, next time the sauce was too watery, etc. With the 6QT - cooked perfectly! And I have FIVE portions of leftovers instead of the 1-2 I had with the smaller I.P.. To put the 3qt vs 6qt in perspective: the 3qt pot does not actually cook 3 quarts because you can't fill it all the way to the top. There's a line that's oh, an inch or two below the lip that's the Max Fill line, because the pressure cooker needs extra room to do its thing. Then, if you're adding the trivet, you're losing another inch of space. So really your cooking space is more like 2 quarts, like a small sauce pan.. Imagine you're cooking ALL of your meals with nothing bigger than a sauce pan.. Then you've got the 6qt pot, which is like the big pots you use to boil pasta. Or make soup.. Pasta pot vs sauce pan. You see what I'm saying?. Anyway, now my problem is that I have to stop cooking so often because I have no more room in my freezer...  :). ********. ABOUT THE 3 QT DUO --- As Instant Pots go, I'll not reiterate what everyone else says but agree that it's a game changer, and totally revolutionizes your cooking. However, I have some regrets.... 3QT Too Small for Lazy Cooks Like Me --- When I to move into my Airstream trailer full time, I decided to get an Instant Pot as I thought it would help minimize the amount of cooking appliances I needed. And of course, being solo (plus a dog and cat) I figured the 3Qt was the better choice. After 7 months with it, I am desperate to trade my 3Qt for the 6QT. I like cooking, but I'm lazy and would prefer to make a large batch once and have left overs, than have to cook for every meal. Reheating leftovers is far easier to clean up than cooking a fresh meal. I'm lazy at cleaning, too.. Instant Pot Learning Curve --- Instant Pot cooking takes some getting used to, and while there is a great abundance of tips and such online, which are fabulous, about 95% of them are for 6QT or larger. Finding good, appropriate recipes for the 3QT is frustrating and has led to lots of failed meals, as ingredients plus liquids, cooking time, etc are all out of proportion.. Where Are All The Accessories for 3QT? --- In the same vein as above, there are tons and tons of accessories for the Instant Pot, but... they're all for 6QT, not a lot for 3QT. I'm starting to see more 3QT-sized accessories (like steam baskets, gaskets, lids, egg bites silicone molds, etc), but only from, like, a single manufacturer. As opposed to stuff for the 6 qt, where you've got a dozen steam baskets to choose from.. Home Cooked Dog Food --- Finally, as I'm traveling a lot city to city, I've started making food for my dog (an 80lb Labrador) as we could never find the brand of dog kibble that she liked and that was good for her. In this situation, the Instant Pot has been my savior, as it's soooo easy to just plop a bunch of raw, frozen chicken or other meats into the pot, slap on lid, push a button and within the hour, I've got tons of fall-off-the-bone meat for my pup's next breakfast (because I inevitably forget to cook for her the night before, and have to do it right at her mealtime). But normal instances when making a batch of her food, again, because I have the 3QT, I could only cook a portion of the meat, take it out, do a quick scrub of the pot before cooking the other portion - whereas with a 6QT that could be done with just one cycle.. In short, if you're thinking about getting a 3Qt for your first and only Instant Pot, don't! Just go for the 6Qt and make your life much easier."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "If there was a 10 star option I'd choose it!", "review_body": "I kept hearing about electric pressure cookers but I always thought back to the noisy monster that mom used on our stove when I was a kid. The one that she wouldn't even allow me into the kitchen when she was using it. And that picture floating around Facebook of the pressure cooker lid embedded in someone's ceiling didn't help! But I read a lot of reviews and webpages and finally broke down and decided to try one.. I bought a PPCXL from Costco and jumped in with both feet. I made several delicious meals using recipes from the web and I canned peppers, jam, and applesauce using recipes from the included book. Then I found out that electric pressure cookers are not safe to can with even though the PPCXL company said it was and included a recipe book for home canning. I ended up having to throw away everything I had already canned and that just annoyed me to the point that I didn't want a product from that company in my home so I returned it and ordered the Instant Pot Duo 7-in-1. I chose this one because a) the company specifically says this product is not safe for pressure canning, it has a stainless steel pot instead of non-stick, and it has the yogurt function.. We\u2019re trying to eliminate all non-stick cookware from our kitchen so going to the stainless pot here was a step in the right direction. I really didn\u2019t think I would use the yogurt function much. I don\u2019t dislike yogurt but it\u2019s not something I ever wanted all the time either so I thought I\u2019d try it once and then go back to buying the occasional container at the grocery store. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong! Even if I wasn\u2019t cooking tons of other fabulous recipes in my IP, the yogurt feature alone has made the IP my one \u201ccan\u2019t live without\u201d kitchen appliance (I even took it RV camping with us!). The yogurt is crazy simple to make and so much healthier than the preservative and sweetener loaded stuff at the store. Milk and a starter (a tbsp. or two of yogurt) are all you need and the IP does all the work while you sleep!. I could go on and on about the yogurt, but then I wouldn\u2019t have time to write about all of the other things you can make. Dishes like Pineapple Pepper Chicken (less than 1 hour including ALL prep and cook time!), Jambalaya (also less than an hour!), and absolutely melt in your mouth fall off the bone ribs. Yes, RIBS! In less than an hour! Want to make some desserts? How about cheesecake or dulce le\u2019 leche? Homemade hummus in less than an hour? Not a problem! Bread? It can do that too!. This really is the most versatile appliance I own. And on those hot summer days when you don\u2019t want to heat up the kitchen it\u2019s a lifesaver! No more hot oven heating up the house for hours, just grab the IP!. If you\u2019re still reading, what are you waiting for? Order yourself this miracle gadget now!. All of the attached photos are of food I've made in my Instant Pot. Pineapple Pepper Chicken, Crustless Quiche, Sausage & Spinach Scrambler, Beef Chili, Roasted Garlic Hummus, Sausage & Kraut, Boiled Peanuts, Yogurt, Jambalaya"},

The surface area of the pressure indicating valve is too small for the weight of the valve to be lifted by steam pressure. Result? The valve stays open and the pot simply boils away the liquid inside and does not build pressure. The \"solution\" is to use an implement of some sort to manually pull the indicating valve up into a sealed position once the pot starts to make steam. If this is not done, the valve will not lift and seal and water will simply boil away. It is important to note that this is not due to a dirty valve, a sticky valve, insufficient liquid or any malfunction. Rather, it is designed into the pot. Ours will be relegated to stock pot duty as we have found it to be totally unusable as a pressure cooker."},

Also, I feel no difference in taste from the standard filter."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "Too slow, even when filter is new, throwing these away", "review_body": "LATER: Okay, after a week of use I am throwing these longlast filters away, 1 unopened.. REASON: long wait for water to pass through. This morning I filled the pitcher and went to take a shower and do some other things. So, 20-30 min later, it was still not empty. Unfiltered water came out into my glass though I poured carefully, that's how full it was. I do keep a second ornamental non-Brita  pitcher that is usually full of already-filtered water when needed, but I just use the filtered water too much for these blue filters to work for me. I was surprised that it was so slow even in the first uses; the white filters are very fast when just replaced.. Changing stars from 2 to 1.. My objection is that instead of rinsing the new filter under the faucet, with these I am told to run and discard 3 pitchers full of filtered water. The filters are slower than the white ones, perhaps because they filter better, but whatever the reason it would take maybe 10 trips through the kitchen over 45 minutes to fill the pitcher 3 times. Not worth it. I'm going to assume that not doing this 3-pitcher routine just means I will drink some charcoal dust. My other alternative is to throw them away and drink unfiltered well water for 4 days until arrival of the new white ones I just ordered.. Also I just noticed what the recommended throughput is for each filter, after which replacement is recommended. For these triple-life filters it is 160 gallons (\"about 6 months for the average family\"); the white filters are comparable, 40 gallons, \"about every 2 months for the average family\". I guess average families don't drink much water, because I, only 1 person (plus I use it for the dogs' water dishes) go through more than a gallon a day. 160 gallons over a 180 day period, 6 months, is 0.9 gallon per day, for an entire family.. As far as cost compared to the regular white filters: let's use their numbers, which say the blue ones last for 6 months each,  and on cost $25.99 for two filters. You get 1 year for $25.99.. The older style white filters come in packs of 3 and  last, according to Brita, 2 months each,  $13.69 for three. So you get 6 months for $13.69, or 1 year for $27.48.. The white ones cost $1.51 more per year, but water runs through faster. Until Brita tells me that these new filters do a better job, and produce independent test results to prove it, I'll save my time and stick with the white ones."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Takes too long", "review_body": "I purchased these in an effort to save time & money. Money I did save, time however is another story.

When I first opened the package and realized how thin it was I immediately thought no way this is gonna work! Well, it does and I love that this mattress protector  isn't bulky, so he can throw it, his sheets and comforter all in 1 load. He is responsible for his bedding, so he removes, washes and makes his bed with no issues.  We bought 2, thinking he can just throw one in the wash and immediately put the clean one on, but have really only used 1 and it has stood up well to nearly daily washings..

I immediately called Instapot and they told me to put a towel Near the back if I wanted to use it and return it to Amazon. I decided to try and cook Brussel sprouts and 2 large baked potatoes. Since I had to send it back I wanted to make sure I was happy with the way it cooked. I was delighted. In less than 13 minutes I had cooked perfect baked potatoes and Brussel sprouts, even though there seems to be a learning curve. I can see this is going to change my cooking habits and I can probabally store some of my cooking pots. Needless to say, I requested a replacement and not a refund. I am only giving this 4 stars due to what appears to be a defect in those fragile brackets.  The tech support guy certainly understood what I was talking about. Attidional note: there are just 2 of us so I ordered the 3 quart. I should have ordered the 6 quart because If I time things right this will take the place of 2-3 pots on the stove."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Not so sure about this product", "review_body": "So far, the Instant Pot mini has sort of worked... and the 3 qt size is perfect for me.  The LED display does not go from ON to HOT on the Saute selection like it is supposed to.  Should I return it for that, I haven't decided yet.  It was hot so I sauteed the onions.. But, why on earth do they suggest that you can SEE the black arrows embossed on the black lid and the black neck of the pot-----  when it would be such a simple thing to print these in WHITE so you can actually see how to set the lid onto the pot?  I took a marker and outlined the arrows, which helps, although of course, you cannot actually make a really visible mark with a marker pen on a black surface.  When the light shines just right, it is sort of makes the marker ink shine slightly."},

Well it came today and I will be contacting Amazon for a return NOT an exchange. This passed the steam test the manual recommends you do but as soon as you add food it doesn't come to pressure and just starts counting down. I not see other reviews stating the same issue and wish I read more of them before ordering..  Please keep in mind I AM NOT a pressure cooker noob, I own 2 others and have no issue with them. For the money and the amount of reviews I am soooooooooooo disappointed.. Hope this helps someone who is about to blow $160 on this thing, don't do it."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Faulty valve in the lid does not seal", "review_body": "This unit is designed with a self sealing valve that is supposed to pop up when the pressure raises to the proper level.  It acts as a locking mechanism for the lid so you can't open the top when under pressure.  We battled with getting the valve to pop up every time we used it.  We kept the valve very clean and really did everything by the book to get the unit to seal up.  We would have to resort to tapping or banging on the the top or shaking the whole unit to get the mechanism to pop into place.  Last night after a frustrating 30 minutes of working to get the valve to seal, we ended up turning the unit off.  I had hoped to open the lid to investigate the problem - mistake!  It was still too hot.  We ended up with a huge mess.  See the photo of the mess we ended up with!  Yikes!  We cleaned it all up and emailed instant pot customer service today to see if they will assist with a solution.  I think the lid was defective to begin with as the seal should pop right up once under pressure.  I am really disappointed with the overall experience, but we will update here if we get a satisfactory level of customer service to fix the problem.  We keep trying because we have had some great meals (despite the effort) from this unit.  Just hope we can get it to work as designed..."},

It's so easy to use, there are so many free recipes online and clean up couldn't be simpler. A few people have bought the Instant Pot just from my recommendation. It's THAT good.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "The best money I ever spent on a kitchen appliance!", "review_body": "I love my Instant Pot!  After watching several infomercials about electric pressure cookers, I did some research.  This Instant Pot had the best reviews and overall customer satisfaction ratings as well as being quite a bit less expensive than the one I saw on TV!. Last night after watching a YouTube video on how to cook a beef roast in the Instant Pot and after reading the instruction manual, I tried that bad boy out.  Below is the recipe I followed with parts I made up myself:. Ingredients:. 1 - 2.5 pound chuck roast. 4 - red potatoes. Weber Chicago Steak Seasoning. Beef Bullion Cubes. Garlic Salt. Minced Onions. About a tablespoon of cooking oil. I took the roast straight out of the freezer and put it on defrost in the microwave just long enough to get it to separate from the wrapper (about 4 minutes).. I put the Instant Pot on Saute and let it get up to temperature.  When it read HOT on the display, I put in just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pot lightly (about a good tablespoon.). Next, I took the frozen roast and put it in the pot and browned it on all sides and ends.  (This took less than five minutes, total.). After the roast was brown, I added two cups of water and 3 beef bullion cubes, a dash of garlic powder, a good coating of the Weber Chicago Steak seasoning and about four tablespoons of minced onions I got at the dollar store.  I put on the lid and hit the Meat / Stew button and per the YouTube video I watched on how to cook the roast, I moved the time up to 41 minutes, made sure the release valve was set to pressure and walked away.. When I heard the timer go off I manually released the steam.  You can do this by gently bumping the release valve so it doesn't all come out at once or just move the release valve to \"release\" and watch it.  Since this was the first time in my life I'd ever used a pressure cooker, I just kept gently bumping the valve to release pressure until the ball thing next to it dropped and I knew it was safe to open the lid.. The result was the best roast I've ever had in my life in about a fourth of the time it would have taken me to cook it in the oven.  The meat was tender and juicy but not mushy.  The potatoes had the flavor of the meat all through them and the broth left from cooking I could've used to make gravy, which I didn't because my guys were hungry.  So I saved the broth to use in a stew.  In less than one hour I had a meal that would've taken me three or four hours to cook to the same degree of tenderness in my oven.  The whole kitchen wasn't heated up, and I was left with a single pot to clean.. If a novice like me can use this bad boy and have such outstanding results, anybody, and I mean anybody can do it!  And, if you work all day and would rather spend your evenings hanging out with your family than hanging out in a kitchen, do yourself a favor and get this machine!  I'm so glad I did.  We have GOOD, HEALTHY food to eat that tastes wonderful and save both time and money.  I love my Instant Pot!"},

Since I didn't purchase the first one through Amazon, I can't look up the exact date of the first purchase, however I would estimate it to have been at least 7 years ago.

Just know that is something the manufacturer warns not to do.  The bleach will soften and compromise the protective coating.  I would say that aside from protecting the mattress very well, it is also a silent and comfortable protector.  I don't believe that many would ever suspect that there is a moisture barrier protector beneath the sheets when a bed is made with this product.

Slightly firm texture; not so much that a mattress pad is necessary but you can feel that it's under the fitted sheet..

There is no such thing as a 3rd generation DUO 80 I found out. None. Due to an error on Instant Pot's website and copied by Amazon, it was advertised as a 3rd generation on Prime Day. I can't blame Amazon because they trusted the manufacturer's description... All 8 qt models as of this writing are the same. They have attached cords and lack other programmability features found on new, smaller models. I noticed this right out of the box when I saw that the power cord was hard-wired rather than the removable cord advertised in the product description. If that were the only difference in this old model and the current models, I could handle that. Unfortunately, the 8 quart models do not have the same programmability functions as the 3rd generation models found in 6 qt designs. If you want to know the differences, do a search on the instant pot website.. I returned it in favor of another 8 qt. brand that is more modern in every way and I'll keep my 6 qt.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "ABSOLUTE gamechanger for time-starved cooks, busy moms and weekly meal prep!", "review_body": "At first, I wasn't sure about all the fuss surrounding the Instant Pot. When I thought about pressure cookers, I thought of my grandmother standing over a stove, canning vegetables from the garden. Boy, was I wrong! This is hands down my new favorite kitchen appliance, and it has saved me so much time in the kitchen. Let me tell you: The Instant Pot is a total game changer for time-starved cooks, working moms, and anyone who doesn't have time to stand over a stove waiting for a pot to boil.. In the month or so that I've been using it, I've made a huge batch of 1-minute quinoa, steel cut oats, homemade refried beans, shredded salsa chicken, hardboiled eggs (for snacking & egg salad), tender thin-sliced steak and brown gravy, and even gluten-free pasta with meat sauce (all in one pot!). It's not always that the IP takes less time (because there is some time involved in coming up to pressure and releasing the pressure), but it's that you can walk away while the magic happens. It automatically kicks over to a warming function after cook time ends, so if you get busy doing something, your food will stay nice and warm!  (I actually picked up a rotisserie chicken from our local supermarket one afternoon, and came home and put it in the Instant Pot on the KEEP WARM function until dinner time. How awesome is that?). It's been really useful for meal prep, too! I am a big fan of cook once, eat twice type meals, and the IP is nice because a big batch of beans, quinoa, brown rice, soup, etc. doesn't necessarily take any extra time to cook. I was able to freeze single servings of quinoa, rice, beans, etc. to use on nights when I don't have time to cook.. There IS a learning curve when it comes to figuring out cooking times, converting recipes, etc., so I recommend joining the Instant Pot group on Facebook, following some food bloggers who share IP recipes, and downloading all the Kindle Unlimited books that you can get as you learn how to use it. Start with something simple, and you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly.. I've also heard a lot of people complain in FB groups about the silicone rings smelling like whatever you last cooked in the Instant Pot, so some people suggest having two rings: one for sweet and one for savory foods. It certainly doesn't affect the flavor of your food (at least, not in my experience) but if that bothers you, you might want to snag an extra silicone ring when you buy your IP.. Overall, I am BEYOND pleased with my purchase and I am happy to share that dinnertime is a little easier at my house thanks to the IP!"},

It's pretty big and takes up a lot of counter space for starters. Which isn't really a deal breaker since crockpots also take up a lot of space, but I figured it's worth mentioning. I got this because I clearly misunderstood the advertised cooking times. I thought a recipe that claimed to take 35 minutes really only took 35 minutes! (plus 10 minutes of prep time of course). Unfortunately, it takes 10-15 minutes for it to come up to pressure, 35 minutes to cook, and potentially up to 20 minutes to release pressure. In the end, it's just doesnt do what I needed it to do and I am returning it. If you are buying the Instat Pot for the purpose of giving you more a more hands off cooking experience; maybe to free up your hands/time so you can do something else, then I could see how this would work out for you. But if you are considering buying to make cooking \"easier\" and all around \"faster\", it's not really worth it IMO."},

Not until they sent me one from different stock did I get a properly functioning one.  LOOK OUT for faulty steam release valve/handles.  If you have the steam release handle pointing to the \u201csealing\u201d position, steam should NOT be escaping from it while you do the \u201cwater test\u201d and the pot comes up to pressure, or while it is cooking at pressure.  You should only be having steam escape out of that valve when you turn it toward \u201cventing.\u201d  This is seperate from the pink float valve.  It is normal for some steam to escape from the pink float valve until it pops up & the pot comes to pressure.. If the steam only stops coming out of the steam release valve/handle by pushing it past the spot marked \u201csealing,\u201d where it feels like it\u2019s NOT supposed to go, or if it keeps coming out no matter what you do, then learn from me: YOU have a DEFECTIVE one!  When I talked with the Instant Pot technical support with my last one, they told me to turn it off, unplug it, and not attempt to use it again.. I ordered mine during the pre-holiday/ Black Friday sales (Nov 2017).  The first I was shipped came badly dented in (probably shipping damage since the outside box was bashed in, too.)  The next two I was sent were BOTH defective.  It wasn\u2019t until I requested I be sent a replacement from different stock, that I got a properly functioning one!  I\u2019m so relieved to finally have a functioning one as of today, January 29th, 2018, two months later!  4th time\u2019s the charm, I guess?  Seriously, it took them sending me 4 Instant Pots, and a lot of headache & my time before I got a properly functioning one.  I will say, that they did at least cover the shipping (as was Amazon\u2019s responsibility since it was an Amazon fulfilled order) for all the replacements, and did even over-night ship one of the times (the third pot...by the fourth, I got the sense the customer service person suspected it was MY fault, so they seemed less eager to help.  I do have pictures & proof of the problematic units they shipped me, and verification that it was NOT user error or my fault.  I\u2019m just so relieved that my 4th one works so I don\u2019t have to deal with this anymore!). So, Quality Control Issues.. IF you get a functioning unit, these really are nice.  Seems everyone around me has one & loves them.  I may not have figured out that my second unit was defective, if it hadn\u2019t been for me brining it to a group get-together where two other friends cooked the exact same recipe (with no problem) in their Instant Pots, while mine malfunctioned with it because of the defective steam release valve/handle, which caused the subsequent \u201cburn\u201d code when trying to come up to pressure.  I had suspected it might be defective before, but was having a hard time ruling out novice user error, or bad recipes, etc.. Pictures: 1) First one came dented in.  2 & 3) pictures from one of the units with defective steam release valve, in case Instant Pot sees this and wants that info. to help correct manufacturing/quality control problem.  4) Shows manual saying that the problem indicates \u201cpressure control fails\u201dand to \u201ccontact support.\u201d  Also shows where I wrote ticket number from my call with Instant Pot technical support.. If I knew how to post videos, I have video of what it looks & sounds like doing the \u201cwater test\u201d with the defective steam release valve.  Basically, it noisily spits steam and water out the steam release valve, even when it is in \u201csealing\u201d position.. Hope my very bad luck helps things go better for someone else, especially if there are any other defective units still getting shipped to people!"},

My mom, my friend, the internet all convinced me that I need this pot. Now, I'm an instant pot lover. So what is it about this pot that makes it such an internet rage? Is it really just a glorified rice cooker? If there is a place that really knows how to make perfect rice, it would be China. Which is why I think its appropriate that this cooker is make there.. But its more than just a rice cooker. This pot has 7 different functions, and a plethora of recipes that can be concocted in those 7 functions. Its like an experimental cook\u2019s dream machine. If you are familiar with a pressure cooker, this is exactly that, it has the pressure release valve that will scare the (*#!&) out of you every single time you switch it over. But don\u2019t let that intimidate you out of this purchase. This is better than a crock pot, in that you can cook some of the same meals, like beans or pot roast in a fraction of the time.. No, its not instant, so, don\u2019t get mad that your dry beans didn\u2019t cook in 30 minutes, because that\u2019s not realistic, but they will get done much faster than stovetop or crockpot. Now, lets talk about space. I have an RV, and this is perfect for making so many meals in this small kitchen space. Maybe you have a great big kitchen in a house and this is just another gadget that you can\u2019t justify adding. I can understand that. But, if you already use the crockpot, rice cooker, and make lots of beans, maybe this would be a good upgrade to your kitchen appliances.. So, here I am, joining your mom, friend, and the internet into trying to talk you into buying your own instant pot. I hope my review helped you make that decision.

I do like it better than my crock pot because the temperature controls on them are so funky now they usually overcook if you don't keep a close eye, and I don't need to think as far in advance.. I would recommend getting multiple seals because it gets stinky fast if you cook chicken with skin on. I bought the color coded ones for when I attempt to do a non-savory dish. Another inner pot would be handy too if you want to store food in it or cook one thing then the next in short order."},

It\u2019s a great complimentary product and the fact it\u2019s given without advertisement adds more value to me. This could have been another average purchase\u2014expectations met, nothing more, nothing less. However, this product surpassed my anticipations, so they\u2019ve earned this praise..

But you never know when it's going to be off, so you can never anticipate and adjust.

It will flash for a few more seconds after you step off before going out.. There is a push button on the bottom to toggle between pounds and kilograms..

The water proof sheets for my children\u2019s' crib sized mattresses have been rendered useless after placing in the dryer by accident (still useable as padding but they lose their ability to block liquids from getting to the mattress after being placed in a dryer) so I recommend hanging any of these types of products up to dry just to be on the safe side despite the laundry directions.

Need I find all the little spoons and rack I didn't keep track of when I replace it to get my money refunded.

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Defective Seal, Poor Customer Service, Great Pressure Cooker When It Works", "review_body": "Loved this pot the first time I used it. It made broth in just a few hours. It made melt-in-your-mouth pot roast in about an hour. I used it about 5 or 6 times, and then the last time I used it steam leaked out the rim of the lid. I watched the help videos on instant pot's website and discovered my ring was slightly stretched--something they admit can happen, though they say infrequently. Since I was well within the warranty period, I contacted them for a replacement. It took two days for them to get back to me and when they did, it was simply to request a picture. A day later, they sent me a note saying they couldn't see the defect, but that perhaps there was a small cut in the ring that they couldn't see. I did not appreciate being treated in this manner. In person, I could clearly see what they could not in a photo--the ring stretched after use. (And not from improper handling.) They asked for my shipping information and my receipt, which I sent. I am waiting for a reply. I assume they will still replace the ring. (I will update here if they do not.) In the meantime, I ordered a replacement ring myself. I'd like to use my pot on a near daily basis and didn't want to have to wait for slow customer service. Replacement rings are over $10 each and the shipping time on them (even with PRIME) is about a month. Their response could have been quicker and more customer friendly, for sure. I don't mind the price of a new ring if they actually last 2 years. I will be upset if the sealing rings don't last for at least 18 months."},

My husband and I have jobs that sometimes require long hours without much notice. So getting home at 7pm when you've started at 7am can leave you exhausted. And when your hungry your first though is \"uuuugh I don't want to have to cook and WAIT an hour or 2 for it to get done! No no!. I've seen and heard such amazing reviews I finally decided to try it.. I bought the 6qt and loved it so much that 2 weeks later I also bought the 8qt. I use the 6qt for my side dishes and the 8qt to cook my main meats!. The lid and inner pot go right in to the dishwasher (after you pull apart the sealing ring on the lid so it can be washed and sanitized properly) so next to no clean up. You can buy your meats in bulk. Just cut your portions, season then freeze! This pressure cooker will even cook from frozen!. Collard greens in 10 minutes. Macaroni and cheese from scratch 10 mins. Whole, free range pasture raised young chicken 30 mins and sooooo juicy! Cheesecake 20 mins! Whole rack of pork ribs 45 mins and literally falling off the bone. Thick porkchops in a cream of mushroom sauce made from scratch 15 mins!. I encourage you all to try this out and you'll wonder how you went without. We very rarely if ever eat fast food or go to a restaurant now. In the time it takes my husband to jump in the car drive down to get fast food, order, pay and head home whatever I threw in the Instant Pot has about 5 or 10 more mins until done. Same thing goes with a restaurant. In the amount of time it takes for my food to come out after you go in, wait to be seated, and finally order.......15 more mins at home and I'll have the same thing but I know the ingredients I used to make it. NON GMO, ORGANIC, FAIR TRADE and not irradiated with a microwave to reheat!. I love both of my Instant Pots. I come from a family of home cooked meals, back when moms and dads worked full time 40+ hrs a week, did homework with the 4 of us kids when they got home and then mom would cook a meal (mostly from scratch with appropriate ratios of veggies to meats to starchy foods) while dad washed behind her as she cooked! I'll always prefer the taste of healthy home cooked meals over processed any day.  But time and energy was fading and it became a challenge to be the same superwoman my mom was (minus the 4 kids)!!! And now I can fit nutritious home cooked meals for my husband and I into our 40-60hr work week!. It's two fold! The more healthy home cooked meals you eat the more energy you have and the better you sleep. Until you do it you have no idea what you're missing out on! Go on give it a go! If you know your way around a kitchen......you'll love all of the things you can do with this!  And just like cell phones and submitting mobile reviews on Amazon you'll wonder how you ever got along without it :-). THANK YOU AMAZON AND INSTANT POT!!!!"},

Add about ten minutes time to what the recipes say for the pot to get up to pressure.. Only real complaint is that the company referred me to a recipe web site when I asked about adjusting recipes for the smaller pot.. (I know: adjusting quantity for a smaller batch is trivial, but is there a cook-time adjustment, or an adjustment for liquid quantities, as a higher percentage of the liquid will be lost during cooking in a smaller pot.)  The recommended website had ZERO information for adjusting for the smaller electric pressure cooker, and did not respond to my blog questions."},

Did they even DESERVE five stars, in comparison? None of those other items have taught me the meaning of life, why should they get as many stars as my Instant Pot??\". I absolutely despise spending a lot of time in the kitchen after work. I am tired, just want to pour a glass of wine, and binge watch Supernatural. I mean *cough* some other, more respectable, grown up television program. Anywho, my boyfriend can't cook to save his life, so that isn't much help either. I'd feel better eating something created out of real, edible foods rather than microwaved in a pouch with fake cheese, so I cook even when I stay over at his house.. This all put me in a difficult spot, thinking about our future. Well, crap. What's going to happen one day when I have kids? If my boyfriend doesn't sharpen his cooking game, I will be the one stuck cooking for our future children. It kills my soul having to cook for JUST ME ALONE after a long day's work, how am I going to pull that off? Turn into a parent who picks up Taco Bell on a regular basis? (Don't get me wrong, I love Taco Bell). Be a constantly cranky and frazzled mom who gets no rest? (I anticipate that anyway, who am I kidding?) Just when I was pondering the option of breaking up and finding a man who can cook (not really), INSTANT POT HAPPENED!. Dinner is done and ready to eat every time in less than an hour. Sometimes WAY less than an hour. I can't believe I survived 30 years without one! It would have been AMAZING back when I was in college! I am constantly learning new things I can whip up (sometimes trial and error, sometimes recipe books). I can throw frozen chicken breasts in it, seasoning, just hit poultry setting, adjust the time up a bit, and boom. Super tender amazing chicken. Something about handling raw chicken makes me too disgusted to eat it once it's cooked, so being able to throw it in frozen is such a relief.. My favorite is to cube up some steak, dust it in taco seasoning, throw it into the pot with black beans and salsa. hit \"meat/stew\", and serve it on top of some wild rice. If I am feeling fancy, put chopped lettuce and tomato on top. If I feel EXTRA fancy, brown some onions with the \"saute\" function before everything goes in. It is so good every time! When I his an Instant Pot creativity roadblock, I just default to that! Also love making oatmeal in it. pro tip: grease the pot with butter before you put all the oatmeal stuff in.. I have bought one for myself, one for my boyfriend's place, one for my mom and dad, and one for my brother. That man of mine is GOING to learn how to cook; even if it is just with the Instant Pot. I have ranted and raved about it to so many people that I've coerced two coworkers, my landlord's wife, my auntie, two separate cousins, and a handful of facebook friends to buy one. They all love it too! Aaahh! It's like we are starting an Instant Pot cult! WE WILL TURN YOU *HISSSSSS*. Man, these guys get a lot of free advertising LOL. But hey, you can't argue with the kind of ratings this thing gets. It's definitely for a reason!!

I saw the Bluetooth Instant pot, and I like technology, but...who's gonna put the food in it? lol. I hate to cook. Been doing Blue Apron for a few months and I loved Blue Apron. I decided it was time to cook on my own, and boy is this the best appliance I have ever purchased. I have cooked more using the Instant Pot than I ever have. Seriously, I can't believe the flavor of the food. The first thing I made was chicken thighs with carrots, celery, and onions. In 20 minutes, I had a meal that was so tasty even my daughter was impressed (knowing how I cook). The chicken was tender, the carrots were soft not mushy, and the flavor was incredible. When I would use a crock pot, everything I made was mushy and it all tasted the same.. The food I made in the Instant Pot was so good, that 3 of my friends bought it too, one bought the 8 quart. The stainless steel pot, along with parts being available thru Amazon is why I chose this one. There are great websites dedicated to Instant Pot, that makes finding recipes a breeze. The best thing I have figured out is this.... Find a recipe you like and use the ingredients you like, just follow approx cook time. Easy really. The user manual kinda overwhelmed me, until I realized it was in several languages..lol After you read it, go to page 17 and do the water test. (I saved the water for my house plants) Then get cooking.. Clean up...I have Farberware stainless steel I received as a wedding gift (lots) of years ago and when I burned things, was a pain to clean. But I knew I did not want a Teflon pot insert. You can saute' right in the stainless steel pot, and then close it up to pressure cooks. Surprised to say, this is easy to clean, especially after I learned to \"deglaze\" it...Don't laugh...  :). Occasionally I put in dishwasher just to disinfect. I found that I am using the manual mode way more than any programmed buttons.. I can't recommend it enough, from someone who really hates cooking. This is the start of my new years resolution to get healthy. According to Dr Mercola, steaming food is very healthy.  You will not be disappointed!. Oh my...When I saw I could add pictures I was so excited.... Leg of lamb, Brussels sprout in 10 minutes and didn't stink up the house, fresh beets...17 minutes! Pork and Sauerkraut, I could go on. I really hope this helps anyone thinking about this pressure cooker. LOVE IT!. I'm buying an air fryer next....for the crispy things...healthy crispy things.. Have a great time cooking in this Instant Pot, it has changed my life."},

But after the second use, I had a problem: the contents would start the countdown and finish the recipe without ever actually sealing the lid.  I was disappointed and mad at myself for getting a \"gadget\". Right away, I emailed customer service. I got a very prompt reply from Tasha, and she worked with me for 2 days explaining what went wrong.  She also explained how my \"fix\" wasn't really a \"fix\", so I learned something I thought I already knew.  The problem was mine, but she never made me feel that way and walked me through a few tests.  Bottom line is there are some variables that will possibly make your pot seem defective - but customer service will walk you through your issue and teach you a few things along the way.  Don't hesitate to contact support! I have complete confidence in this appliance, because of their commitment to an excellent customer experience.  I also love the recipe support.  Thanks, Tasha!"},

These are NOT color fast. They definitely bleed. If you wash them together, they will transfer color onto each other, even after several washings.. If you dry them, it kind of wrecks them. I have accidentally thrown a couple in the dryer with other clothing.  Once they have been dried, they get sort of a velcro situation and stick to each other and themselves.. Contrary to what I've read here, they do still leave little lint particles on windows and mirrors, not horribly bad, but they are there nonetheless.. Lastly, the thing I don't like is how EVERYTHING sticks to them even after washing. I use them to wash the floors, etc. Even after washing there is always debris stuck in them (grass mostly) I don't want to spend time picking grass and junk out of a cleaning rag so I'm trying to keep the cloths I use for cleaning and dusting separate when I wash them. Kind of a pain, since the last thing I want to do is take special care of cleaning rags!"},

Then I'll pick up something close by, but relatively light, like my phone, and it will still read 168.8.  Even though I know my phone probably weighs close to a pound.

I purchased the mattress protector to save my guest bed mattress if her water broke during the night while she was sleeping.  Well....of course it did break in the middle of the night, and this protector did just what it was supposed to do.....kept the mattress clean, dry, and stain free.  Easy to strip from the bed and wash.  I hung it on a rack to dry, then ran it through the dryer with air only to soften and fluff.

I have a six quart stove top pressure cooker that I never remember to use, as it requires I stand there and watch it for most of the process.  This sweet new appliance seals, comes to pressure, cooks for the allotted time, and then keeps the meal warm and brings down the pressure all by itself.  I can set it and forget it.  Love the six quart size and the inner stainless steel pot cleans up nicely.  Be aware, this is a pressure cooker.  You are not going to get stir fried veg from this, but inexpensive cuts of meat and legumes will be perfectly cooked.  It does a bang up job on rice and I was so pleased to be able to cook dried beans and have them come out soft and tender.  I am using it at least once a week now, and have used it more in a couple of months than I ever used my stove top pan in the entire time I owned it.  My next venture will be potato salad cooking the eggs and potatoes all at the same time.  Sweet.  There are tons of ideas and recipes on the internet for this, which you will need, as the instruction booklet and recipe booklet leave much to be desired.. If you see some mineral deposits develop on the stainless steel inner pot, just put some water and a little cream of tarter in and put the appliance on simmer.  It will disappear and look as good as new.  The exterior wipes clean easily and so does the lid.  The seal does seem to retain odors, but I store mine with some crumpled up newspaper inside, and that seems to absorb the odors.  They do not affect the end product anyway.. I think if you cook in large quantities, want to speed things up, and are not looking for \"crisp\" vegetables, you will be thrilled with this appliance"},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "This is not your grandmothers pressure cooker!", "review_body": "I have had my instant pot now for a few days and I am absolutely in love!. If you are reading reviews trying to figure out if you should buy one or not here is my opinion after research and my own trial and error!. Why Instant pot over other brands? Instant put is stainless steel on the inside .. not non stick. you don't have to worry about cooking your food in chemicals or worry about the nonstick coating wearing down and into your food.. I would recommend getting the 6qt unless you have a huge family i could see the 8qt however the 8 qt is quite big and may be bigger than most would care for. We are a family of 3 and the 6qt is way more than enough for us or even for a family of 5!. If you feel scared, overwhelmed, intimidated... that is NORMAL. There is so much information it is complete information overload. You may even feel like \"what the heck did i get myself into ?\" when going through the directions.  Breath- take it slow- youtube some videos if needed or if you have Facebook look for the instant pot Facebook page- you will find many nice and helpful people there to help you!. Some tips on getting started... Be sure to start out with doing the water test.. it will test to make sure your pot is functioning correctly, it will steam clean the inside for you before your first venture and it will even help ease the nerves a bit too.. Start with something easy... like hardboiled eggs! I have done 3 batches of hardboiled eggs in the past 5 days! They are so incredibly easy,  taste SO good and they are SO easy to peel! I do the 5-5-5 method. 5 minutes on high pressure cook, 5 minutes natural release (leave it alone for 5 minutes it will count up to L 5  manually release the rest at that point ) and put into an ice bath for 5 minutes. PERFECTLY hardboiled eggs!. 2nd I made something easy but more difficult... Homemade Mac and Cheese  IN TEN MINUTES! it only took 10 minutes to make homemade mac and cheese! The family loved if.. i don't think i can go back to Kraft.... 3rd.. I wanted to try meat and a bit more of a challenge... I made this most amazing meatloaf ever.. I still get nervous and feel overwhelmed and second guess myself. I can't wait to be so comfortable with it i am willing to experiment and do my own thing... I am not there yet but the learning curve is worth it. This is life changing!. For cleaning, you will need to clean the different pieces which can be a pain but its the sanitary thing to do, don't be lazy :) The Stainless steel insert is dishwasher safe.. if you find you are having a hard time with burnt on food a good soak in hot water and soap and it comes off easy.. for anything REALLY burnt on you can scrub with bar keepers friend. The cover you will want to wash by hand. I was the silicone ring by hand too.. not sure if you have to but i do.... don't forget to wash the plastic drip collector thing.. if you forget about cleaning that.. it may be growing your own science project.... gross."},

My husband is Mexican and carnitas are his favorite food so I thought I'd get one to try it out and hope everyone was right. I was pretty terrified of it at first but I read a bunch of Facebook posts about it and that made it less intimidating. The first thing I made (after the water test) was the carnitas and they KNOCKED OUR SOCKS OFF. Then I made rice and it came out better than my old rice cooker. Tonight I made Country Ribs and the entire family went wild. I've had this IP for roughly 48 hours and I'm already using it for a fourth time right now to make oatmeal. Get one.

This is my first instant pot, and seeing it in action has me really pumped to get a full size Max model in a couple months! A big question a lot of people have who don't have instant pots is \"So, it's a pressure cooker. Old manual models can do that, so what makes an overpriced hunk of electronics worthwhile?\" THIS THING DOESN'T HISS! Like at all! I was so shocked. I had an old stovetop model and was prepared for the hissing of the weight, and was very confused when I didn't hear my little machine hiss, but sure enough, the float was up. A hour later, no noise, I hear a beep and this thing starts depressurizing. Lo and behold, it actually pressure cooked without any noise or steam spraying everywhere. If I had to guess, the temp sensors in the pot allow it to only give the unit the exact amount of thermal energy it needs for the pressure, so it doesn't go spitting out steam. Either way, pressure cooking without hearing hissing behind me or worrying about steam damaging the cabinets the whole time will be huge in my house. I also tested the saute function a little bit. High heat does a really good job of getting a sear on meat while low is really great for a simmer that doesn't boil over."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Seems to be designed by somebody who doesn't do housework", "review_body": "Recently my Cuisinart pressure cooker died, so I decided to try something different.. Guess I don't need to repeat the pros since there are already plenty of those. Here are some suggestions for the manufacturer:. 1. the rubber (or silicone) pad under each foot is way too small, it cannot hold on a smooth granite counter top. To press a button, you have to hold the cooker using one hand, push the buttons using another hand. More importantly, the cooker may slide off the counter top easily when serving food.. 2. the little stem with a silicone cap in the lid: in a busy home, you don't expect to watch every small parts which may drop out and get lost. Unfortunately, the silicone cap seems to be easy to rub off from the stem when washing the lid by hand. Cuisinart cooker doesn't have such small loose parts.. 3. The lid top: why the metal top is not covered by plastic? I agree it looks cool with a shining metal top, but it doesn't make sense to prioritize the visual appeal above safety. It can be very hot to touch. And if the user gets burned by the metal top while holding the lid, he/she may drop the lid all together. This could break the counter top, the floor, or hurt anybody around, especially little kids.. 4. the silicone ring is way too hard to get out and clean. I am sure the designers of this product never do any housework.. Other than those, it seems to do its job as expected, i.e. cook food."},

I can't imagine not having one in my kitchen now. Other than the reduced cook time, the next best thing is all the functions it performs. For me, appliances have to earn their place in my kitchen and this one definitely does. I love that I can saute right in the pot then add the rest of the ingredients, program it and walk away. I also love the slow cooker and rice maker functions and that I don't need separate appliances for each.. Unfortunately, after four months one of the sensors failed and it stopped working. I didn't remove a star because the Instant Pot customer service was awesome. I submitted the ticket online, along with my proof of purchase from Amazon and a video of the error.

But it also seems that this is the \"gadget du jour\" for a lot of food bloggers lately. They raved about this item and I think some of them were given one to review so I was a bit skeptical. But there was a recipe on Nom Nom Paleo that I was dying to try. And the things this pot promises to do! Slow cooker, steamer, saute, rice maker, yogurt maker (yeah like I'll ever do that in my lifetime) and of course the instant pressure cooker feature.. I finally bit the bullet and ordered it and it sat in my cupboard for a good month. Images of my mother's old pressure cooker which didn't exactly EXPLODE but did leave beef stew on the ceiling, kept stopping me in my tracks as far as using it. Saute, sure. Slow Cook....sure.  Instant Cook....ummmmmmmm gimme a minute.. Finally the Mexican Beef recipe (kind of Carne Guisada), kept calling my name and I set sail on the INSTANT POT sea. Armed w/ my ingredients, the Instant pot, and a couple of pounds of the most gristle filled, hard to cut grass fed beef, I girded up my loins and had at it. Well let me say that in 1 1/4 hours (including prep time), I had the MOST tender Mexican Beef I could imagine. Cooking that meat for 10 hours in the crock pot couldn't come close to the melt in your mouth Guisada that this little puppy produced. It was as easy as saute, dump in all the ingredients, hit MEAT/STEW and walk away. I'm totally psyched, can't you tell? Get this. Get this NOW!"},

I didn't need to fumble with converting from kg to lbs, it was already set to lbs, although there is a button on the back of the scale if you need to convert.. The scale is also very fast. I've had slower scales in the past, and this one takes about two seconds as long as you are properly balanced and the scale will blink before it gives you the final weight..

I waited a while to make this review so that I could get to know the appliance.  So here goes....  I love using my Instant Pot more every time I use it.  With only a little adjustment I have adapted many of my recipes and  become totally in love with the ease of using a pressure cooker.  I still haven't made yogurt yet, but look forward to success with that as well."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Instant Pot vs. Cuisinart electric pressure cooker", "review_body": "As nearly all things I have ordered through Amazon, the pressure cooker arrived when expected in fine condition. With this purchase I am replacing a much loved Cuisinart electric pressure cooker that is still available, and is $30 less expensive. I chose the InstantPot because the Teflon coating was wearing hard on my 2 year old Cuisinart which is bad (and not because of metal utensils). Also, I'd had to already replace the silicone ring (expected), but most recently the pressure sealing pop-up value has been problematic so the unit never pressurized. I thought about replacing the parts (i.e. the lid) but that was $55 and it seemed better to replace the whole unit at that price. So I will compare (thus far) the Cuisinart to the Instant Pot (IP) and hope it helps others since I couldn't find a similar comparison.. Many people note that the instructions for the IP aren't good. They are correct. IP seems to run home to its roots of stove top items and PSI numbers.  Cuisinart never did, so I never learned this \"language.\" I used my stove top Fagor only briefly. And for an electric, you don't NEED to know that stuff. You only need to know what the machine's buttons do.  For my first try, I wanted to make just simple white rice. This unit is billed as a \"rice cooker,\" after all. But even the recipe in the booklet enclosed (for basmati rice) doesn't use the \"Rice\" function on the machine. I searched far and wide for what pressing the rice button meant -- how long would it cook? how much rice does the Rice setting function plan for you to be cooking, and how should you adjust timing up or down based on volume? Using Basmati rice and their ratio's of 1:1.5 grain to water, I did a manual high pressure for 8 minutes on 3 cups of rice. It was very, very good, but maybe a minute too long--the top was lovely and loose, but the bottom was clumpy and a bit further done than desirable. Now I am making a stew. Compared to the extremely hot browning function on the Cuisinart, even in a nonstick pot, the saute function in the Instant Pot's stainless pot (a major draw for me) felt a bit anemic.  It browned nicely, but took much more time than a fast browning sear should, and the heat level went from \"on\" to \"hot\" (Hot being the goal) when I added cool things to the pan. (And I was browning 5-6 chunks of stew meat at a time. Not a lot.  For both the rice and now the stew, the \"come to pressure\" time feels longer than the Cuisinart's. Still, I am charmed by the idea of making homemade yogurt, and that was an appeal to me on this unit. The rest I will figure out with time, because I refuse to be bested by a machine's clunky instructions when I believe we can develop a great relationship. I'll update on the Stew function.  I browned the meat, saut\u00e9ed some aromatics, and dumped in your usual stew vegetables, wine, beef broth and hit the STEW function, which sets at 35 minutes under pressure. I would estimate it took 10-15 minutes for the IP to reach the pressure level to begin the countdown. Again -- no telling how much meat and vegetables their 35 minutes means -- and that's just too bad that Instant Pot isn't responding to make things more clear.  I will say that compared to the Cuisinart, the IP unit spews much less steam, is quieter, sits a bit shorter, has a top that is more intuitive, and the truly lovely design of dual lid holders to catch the lid liquid without having to set a hot, wet lid on the counter when you're dealing with a steaming unit. That is a very, very good thing. Amazon gets a 5 on shipping. Instant Pot has what I believe to be a great unit if I can maximize its functionality, which is not something I want to work terribly hard to accomplish. But I hear some beeping so the Stew has completed and the unit has gone into warming. Here's hoping!. Adding on from several days later. The stew was terrific, but a minute or two less on the meat would have been fine. Since then I've made an awesome soup and a lovely lemon/basil skinless, boneless chicken breast I'm sure to make again. I figured out that the saut\u00e9 function could be elevated and I am content that it is, while not my stovetop, not anemic. I still think the Cuisinart is hotter, but I did love sauteeing the chicken in a bit of olive oil and butter tonight with a perfect outcome.  My decision is to worry less about the function buttons, which I will learn over time, and focus on the basics I know and the recipes I love.. If you are thinking about buying an electric pressure cooker, don't waste a second more time in thought. Just GET one. You will love the investment, you will use it, you will make great meals fast, and you will explore cuts of meats and vegetables that you might not otherwise have tried, and love them. These appliances are AWESOME. I had a love affair with my Cuisinart but feel like my second relationship with Instant Pot is already terrific.  I am delighted with the functionality and the more I use it, the more I love it."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Join the Instant Pot Community. You'll be glad you did!", "review_body": "I first learned of Instant Pot on a Facebook forum. I did some research on electric pressure cookers and realized this one was the one to buy. I haven't had it for long, but it's been great so far. I made the most delicious Lemon Garlic Chicken! It fast and easy. I haven't even scratched the surface of what I can do with this thing. Since this is the most popular brand, there is numerous FB groups and other forums for advice and recipes. My next culinary creation is going to be cheesecake using my Fat Daddio Push Pan. According to the numerous owners in the \"club\" cheesecake is easy and fabulous in the Instant Pot. One thing I would advise is to buy an extra silicone ring, one for savory and one for sweet dishes. The silicone seal absorbs the aroma of onions and garlic and can \"contaminate\" your sweet desserts like cheesecake with the smell of what you last cooked. They can be ordered on Amazon for just a few dollars and are definitely worth the extra money. The 8 quart rings currently take 10-12 weeks to arrive, but hopefully won't take as long at some point in the future. It's always good to have an extra ring anyway. In my opinion, the manufacturer should include an extra ring in the box with the product.. One other thing: if you're trying to decide between the 6 quart and the 8 quart, buy the 8 quart. Most people in the IP (Instant Pot) community say if you're buying your first one, you should buy the larger one. Yes, I said your first one. Most people end up buying a second one because it's so versatile and replaces other kitchen appliances like your rice cooker, slow cooker, etc. My \"geriatric\" rice cooker is not going to last much longer, and when it dies, I plan to buy another IP to replace it. Also, be prepared to want to buy some \"accessories\" for your new IP such as the pan I mentioned above. This is so fun to experiment with, you'll want to try to cook things you've never tried before (like cheesecake)."},

We bought a 6 quart pot in July 2016 and LOVED it. We used it so much we decided to give it to good friends and order the 8 quart. But while the old model was reliable and easy to use, the new model that arrived in December 2016 had a redesigned valve and seal. This new unit had a floppier seal. It doesn't seal 75% of the time unless I watch it and either push it down to seal during the pressuring period, or open and forcefully press down the lid. The old one was set and forget. The new one sometimes never seals, or it has lost most of it's moisture through steam before it does seal, leading to dried or burned food. It's awful. I wrote to the company to ask for a replacement rubber ring (it's much floppier than the old design) and they were snide and accusatory in their response. They gave me a long list of things to check before writing back to them. No thanks for the hassle. I found replacement silicone rings for $10 and hope it might solve the issue. What a disappointment."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Liked mine so much I bought my second a week later-- only drawback...", "review_body": "Love my Instant Pot(s). I have two--bought #2 a week after having my first.. It's a versatile piece of cooking equipment that has me doing thing I never even thought about doing just a few weeks ago... making great soups, healthy apple crisp, yogurt and greek yogurt, easy poached and hard cooked eggs, and all the kinds of things you would typically think of with a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, saute pan, yogurt maker... I don't even remember all it does.. What I really like-- I control all of my ingredients while easily and quickly making things that I might otherwise buy packaged. We are eating more fresh and real food without the stuff I can't pronounce. My fridge is always stocked with jars of fresh soups, fruits, vegetables, yogurts and great healthier snack options.. The biggest drawback I have experienced so far-- everyone got one for Christmas. Because electric pressure cookers have suddenly caught on, finding reliable sources of recipes for all the things that an Instant Pot can do is tough. There are thousands of amateur recipes flying around. Every day hundreds and maybe thousands of new recipes are posted on Pinterest and Facebook and cooking blogs. Some of them are amazing, but some are way off. Even the Instant Pot Recipe book that came with both of my Instant Pots is screwy. On page 26, there is a recipe for \"3 Minute Steel Cut Oats\". I tried it, my Steel Cut Oats were as chewy as wood. In looking back to see what I did wrong, I was flipping through that same book. On page 32 there are cooking time tables which show that you need to cook Steel Cut Oats for on high pressure for 10 minutes.. Getting cooking times right is a little tricky in that you need to adjust for the amount of liquid you are bringing up to heat, and the mass and starting temp of the food that needs to warm enough for the steam to start building up enough to hit pressure and start the \"high pressure cook time\".. Again, finding reliable recipes and adjusting cooking times is the quirkiest thing, but if I had it to do all over, I would still have 2. (I was just going to buy a spare liner/pot and spare seal rings, but when I went to do that, for a little more I just bought another complete unit. They aren't that expensive and I can see myself using both at the same time for parties.. Buy one (or two)... you'll love it!"},

It's EASY to clean (yay!), it's easy to operate, and it doesn't heat up the kitchen. I had never used a pressure cooker before (and neither did my mom, so I didn't grow up around them), so I was nervous about all the horror stories that float around about beans on the ceiling, etc. Not to worry; they have engineered this so that you can't get the lid off unless all the pressure has been released. If you're considering buying this item, take a look on youtube for Instant Pot videos; there's lots of them available, and you'll quickly learn how versatile it is, and how much everyone loves it. I use this so much that I keep it on the counter (along with my Vita Mix). I would recommend the Instant Pot whole heartedly!"},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "GREAT APPLIANCE - UPDATE STILL 5 STARS", "review_body": "I'm not much of a cook and I've ruined meat more than I'd like to admit.  The Instant Pot gives me HOPE !!  I've used it several times since receiving it in early January.  It offers a range of tools from simple to complex.  Until I become totally familiar with it, I have to double check the user's manual, but when I don't try to \"wing it\" I have great success.. I find that with some cuts of meat, I have to add time to the cooking because they just need more time.  For example, corned beef takes longer than most recipes will suggest.  It was much better the second day with additional cooking.. So far, my best outcomes have been chicken cacciatore, chili and beef stew.  Next up will be chicken breasts and pork roast.  I expect to be successful.. One suggestion:  if the cut of meat is likely to be tough try using the pressure cooker setting as in the recipe, then turn it to a lower/slower setting for another hour (or whatever time you think it needs).  My beef stew was better the second day because when I reheated it, I actually was cooking it longer.. I think I will need to experiment with what works best for each cut of meat and learn from experience.. SO GLAD I bought this thing !!  Because, so far, it's given me great results.  Lots of recipes on line, too.. I really like the saute feature as most recipes allow you to saute the meat and onions/garlic/celery etc., then add the other ingredients, close the lid, and set it/forget it.. One thing I have to remember is to allow it to get to full pressure before manually setting the timer.  A couple of times I thought it was cooking only to discover that I had not let it get to pressure.. READ THE USER'S GUIDE !!!  And check out all the online recipes.. Actually, I just sent one to my sister who needs to start eating healthier meals on a limited budget.. UPDATE:  FEB 15. REMEMBER WHEN I SAID TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS?  Well, I was using the TIMER button instead of the ADJUST button.  So all I was doing was delaying the start of the cook time.  DUH !!!  Setting the Instant Pot to cook my items manually requires me to FIRST set the pressure.  THEN, manually ADJUST the time up or down using the ADJUST button.  Do all this within the first 10-15 seconds after you begin the process or you will need to press the cancel (KEEP WARM BUTTON) and start over."},

I only gave it 4 stars because it isn't noise free, it make a little bit of sound when you stand or movie around a bed. It not super loud but its there. (i have a newborn child and im always afraid he'll wake up from the noise). the other reason is my other son had spilled apple juice on the bed and it soaked through to the protector and it out of nowhere turned the apple juice stain pink so now theres a huge pink spot on the protector.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Fantastic once you conquer the learning curve", "review_body": "Just remember you can always add more time but you can't uncook!. I don't want to rehash what other reviews have covered. I hope these are additional points. I've done a whole dinner in 45 minutes from saute start to natural release finish without adding a degree Fahrenheit to my kitchen. I have not thrown it on a meter to test the power consumption but I suspect that it's a  fairly low total compared to using a stove or a slow cooker for several hours, plus it doesn't heat up your house in summer so will save your A/C from overwork. We already know it's a time saver but also the net power savings will add up over time.. There is a learning curve and it requires some trial and error. I found there is no one rule of thumb for adapting stove-top PC recipes to this one that will work consistently. Do not think you can just add 15-25% time to recipes for nonelectric cookers. I took six books out of the library, four were written for stove-top models, one for mostly electric pots and one that gives times for both in each recipe. The one consistent thing I've found is that the Instant Pot loses very little liquid so I usually add less than called for. Some recipes need extra time for electric, some do not, and some need even less time though they were written for stove-top and 15 lbs pressure. Err on the low side. You can always close it up and add a few more minutes of cook time (don't forget the extra cooking while it releases pressure) but you can't uncook a soggy mess!. If you have a good library check out some books, or go online -- there's ton of info. Start with Instant Pot's own site and check out Laura Pazzaglia's hippressure blog. Those two sites have stuff that's specifically for the electric pots and shouldn't need to be adapted. Check out other food sites, and read the comments as you will learn from people who've tried to alter stove recipes for an electric pot.. Consider purchasing an extra gasket. Odors like onion and garlic tend to cling and you want to thoroughly wash and dry a gasket before storing it. Having an extra one helps, plus you will hopefully not get stuck in years hence needing a gasket that may no longer be available (happened to me with an ancient Presto).. I contacted Instant Pot support once with a random question and they got back to me very quickly. Good company with a good product. I highly recommend the Instant Pot and consider it one of my better purchases.. I hope somebody finds this helpful. If you have a question please comment -- I'm no expert but I'll do my best to answer."},

They answered almost immediately and assured me that the problem was not my unit but an error in my instruction manual which they have since corrected.. So, if you\u2019re like me \u2014 obsessed with reading reviews BEFORE purchasing items, and obsessed with reading manuals and testing products BEFORE using them \u2014 here's the CORRECTION: Instead of adding water to the \u201c3\u201d mark on the inner pot as posted in their \u201cInitial Test Run\u201d instructions, use only \u201c3 CUPS WATER\u201d instead. I ran a third test using these new instructions from the customer service rep, and my unit is NOT defective!"},

I looked on the internet and youtube and found out I was dreadfully late to the party which is instant pot owners.  Directions, recipes, new ideas, hints, everything on the web.  Stainless steel cooking vessel inside.  Where was this when I was in college??? bed,desk, Instant pot.  The 3 qt. mini is the way to go for up to three people.  I actually laugh and shake my head sometimes when loading it up and turning it on.  Some recipes are quite literally dump and run. It is unbelievable!!!!!!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Works as advertised!  Recommended!", "review_body": "I've only used the unit to cook 4 things:. - Brown rice, chicken, mushrooms, carrots (all at once in the Instant Pot). - Peanut Chicken. - Sweet Potatoes. - Hard boiled eggs. All of them turned out great.  In my limited use of the product, I think the biggest reason to use the product is convenience.  You dirty many less pots and you can 'set and forget',  It's just really easy and convenient to use.. For example, the brown rice, chicken dish I mentioned.  I literally put raw brown rice, chicken stock, mushrooms and carrots in the Instant Pot.  I put the lid on and set the timer for 26 minutes.. The dish came out great.  The rice was perfectly cooked, the chicken was juicy and tender and the vegetables were cooked but not mushy.  Think about the steps, pots, and effort involved in typically preparing this meal.  Soaking the rice, cooking it separate from everything else.  Cooking the vegetables and chicken separately.  Again, all I did but throw everything in the pot and set the timer for 26 minutes.  One pot to clean afterwards!. The other items came out out just as well.  The cooking time time is better than conventional cooking but not as much as you'd think because of the time it takes the pot to pressurize.. As with most wildly popular products, this one is certainly slightly over hyped.  It's not a miracle appliance but I would certainly recommend it.  It's overpriced due to its popularity, but if you're going to actually use it regularly, it's worth it."},

Yes, I tried in a different part of the house first to be safe. I've not had any problems with any other appliances in the kitchen or anywhere else for the five years I've been here."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Love this one!", "review_body": "Dear Instant Pot:. I will not test you any more. I truly love you and will go to any extent to keep you safe and happy with me. I take you to be my beloved companion from this day forward for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part!!. - Yours truly. I was at my wit's end with my pressure cooker. I am Indian, have a high pressure full-time job and I have a toddler to take care of. I like to cook and cook a lot. I can literally count the number of times we eat out per year. My husband is Vegan and I have tested and tried several recipes successfully but have always wished some brilliant mind would design a pressure cooker that is exactly like the Instant Pot -. Stainless steel (for healthy cooking), easy to clean manually (this takes less than a minute to wash!), dishwasher safe, easy to understand settings, large (to cook for a large gathering), no mess at all on the cooker's lid (versus a huge mess that I have been dealing with for years now), cooks really fast, cooks really slow (when I want that - in 'slow cooker' mode), is a rice cooker/pressure cooker/slow cooker/soup pot - all in one!!. The Instant Pot is just that and much more. It has several cooking modes (Steam, saute, multigrain, pressure cooking, slow cooking, yogurt maker) and a ton of other settings. It has been a big hit so far with every single thing I have tried. I have tried making brown rice in different rice cookers and in several different pressure cookers which almost always used to end up in a mess. At the end of it, the brown rice would not even be cooked. I almost had told myself that I would never end up making brown rice successfully my entire life. With almost \"no effort\" at all on my part, I have been making brown rice in the Instant Pot and it has been turning out so well!. Being Indians, lentils ('dals') are a staple food. Both the lid and the base of my old pressure cooker would get messed up almost every time I used it. The 'dal' would not get cooked but we had to spend a lot of time scrubbing the lid as well as the base of the cooker. The Instant Pot is a blessing. Anything I say about it is not going to be enough. You have to buy and see the difference yourself as it works its magic. I have tried making several curries, steaming veggies, etc and it was magical - at least for me.. The only drawback I see is that someone with less counter space in the kitchen may find this to be a little bulky. I am big into style and looks and tend to go for contemporary styling with the smallest of things I buy. Instant Pot is the only exception to that. Because of how much it can simplify your life, I am okay with this looking a little bulky. Despite the fact that it takes up space, I would recommend this to anyone because if you own this, you should be able to give away multiple cookers/appliances that you may own. The Instant Pot can easily replace a slow cooker + a pressure cooker + a rice cooker and probably a few more appliances/cookers you may own. I have not even been using my stove top and the usual pans that I used quite frequently (before) ever since Instant Pot came into my life. Most of cooking happens inside the IP.  You will love it too."},

They asked for and received all the particulars on the package, like zebra code, UP, date and proof of purchase. I thought they might then trace the manufacturing site and let me know an outcome. I even asked for their suggestions. When I didn't hear back in a week, I emailed them again to remind them. No reply and still none, 2 months later. After years of trusting Brita brand, ended up trying a PUR pitcher and filter. It's a wonderful relief to have good tasting and fresh smelling water again.

I put in the food and the water, pressed pressure cook and like magic it was just done when it beeped.  Getting used to the pressurization wasn't hard at all.  It wasn't really difficult to use.. Until last week... My pot just didn't turn on! I tried other outlets and other electronics so it was not the outlet. I moved the pot to a different outlet, nothing. It was the pot. The manual gave explicit troubleshooting directions based on what is wrong. Not turning on meant that the circuit board blew and it advised to call support, which I did. When you call, an automated message tells you to go online and put in a ticket- because this is clearly a company that doesn't want to be bothered 'talking' to their customers. So I do this. A day later no response! So I email again asking for help. This time I email them the same information. Didn't hear from them until Friday! I needed my pot fixed on Tuesday.... On Thursday though I had had enough and called Amazon who thankfully knows how to treat customers and were able to refund me the product and I shipped it back to them. The pot was less than a year of purchase and within warranty after all! Even Amazon tried getting ahold of the company and they couldn't get a response!. Beware of this brand! I would look for another pressure cooker because when it breaks, and it likely will, you won't be getting help for days..... My first attempt to post this review Amazon blocked for an unknown reason.

It failed the initial water test by displaying the \"burn\" message.  Customer service at Instant Pot has consistently taken the position that I, a Chef of over 40 years, don't know ow to cook rather than admitting that I have received a defective device.  They even went so far as telling me that I purchased the product from an \"inauthentic\" seller (Amazon), and that they would honor the warranty as a \"one time courtesy\". When I asked them for the contact information for the regulatory agency in Canada that is responsible for oversight of their industry, they have been silent.  No response to my email request. Fortunately, Amazon has stepped up to the plate and said that they would replace the product since the manufacturer has failed to live up to their responsibility.  Amazon is WONDERFUL!!!  That's why we purchase several thousands of dollars of products per year through them.  Amazon rocks!  Instant Pot has gone from a company with superior products and outstanding service to an entity that doesn't deserve to remain in business.  Unreliable products and very poor customer service.  They have been totally unresponsive to emails sent to sales and marketing. I use 3 Instant Pots simultaneously in my day-to-day meal preparation. When it comes time for replacement of these units, I will certainly be looking at other manufacturers because I cannot trust Instant Pot to provide quality products and honest customer service.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Excellent - and just ordered Fagor steamer basket to go with it.", "review_body": "Love it so far. I was disappointed though that they don't offer either a steamer basket, glass lid, nor silicon lid for the pot. I think for the money, it should have at least come with the silicon lid and the other two items could be optional, but at least available. If I could take off half a star for these annoyances, I would.. I know I'm going to use this unit all the time for steaming since I tried it on green beans the other day and it was fantastic. The unit heats up to cooking temp in about 4 minutes and the beans are done in another 2 minutes or so. With this steamer basket I just ordered, I'm hoping this will work out very nicely.. So, which 3rd party steamer basket? I did a fair amount of research and my decision came down to these two because I wanted a steaming container, not just a shallow steaming platform. I want to be able to pull the whole thing out easily and not have to worry about dumping some of the contents back into the steam water, if you know what I mean. So again down to these two:. 1. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019D7MSZA/ref=psdc_289761_t2_B007SPKR8U - This one works according to some reviewers of the 8qt model. It fits if you remove the handles. For some folks that might be a bit of a challenge to remove those with a hacksaw or other tool.. 2. https://www.amazon.com/Fagor-998338900-Pasta-Basket/dp/images/B0000717BM - I chose this one.. I chose the Fagor because it has a handle that swings out of the way and I did ideally want a handle. One thing I don't know about this. \"pasta basket\" is whether it has holes in the bottom. After all it is a pasta basket, not a steamer basket specifically. If it doesn't have holes in the bottom, I'm going to test steaming and see how it works since there are plenty of holes on the sides. Seems to me it should work quite well whether there are holes in the bottom or not. But, if I'm wrong and think it's not performing quite right, I'll drill holes in the bottom if they are indeed not already there. I can't tell from the picture. It also does not have a platform to raise above the water, so I'll just put the Instant Pot trivet beneath it.. So far I made chicken soup (came out great and fast), boneless country style ribs (came out fall off the bone tender and tasty in an hour), and the green beans I steamed. The steaming feature really surprised me how fast it is. After all pressure cookers always take awhile to heat up. But I'd forgotten that it's only heating up about a cup and a half of water, not six quarts of liquid and solids before it's up to temp. So, it's very fast steaming. I'll update this review in regard to the choice of steamer basket. Option #2 is a bit more costly though but still reasonable, I think. It was $18 including shipping from Fagor.. All for now..."},

I have to say - I find it a bit intimidating and I was really disappointed by the recipes that were included in the instruction manual. They were really nothing that either I, or anyone in my family would eat. So where to go from here - I like the idea of a single pot and reduced cooking time. I headed to youtube for videos of people getting started and some recipes from pinterest. It would be really useful for the manufacturer to do video \"tutorials\" just to get you started. Having tried a couple of basic chicken recipes it works quite well. Essentially, I've traded the time I'd save in cooking with time scouring the internet for tips, tricks and ideas.  It will take me a while to learn how to use it properly, so whether or not I stick with the learning curve remains to be seen. I have several friends who are fans, so I'll probably get with them for tips. Hope that helps other people with a realistic view."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I did not believe I would use the Instant Pot very often. I was wrong.", "review_body": "I didn't believe I would use the Instant Pot. There are many glowing reviews, but their content boils down to \"it cooks faster\".. So? When we make mashed potatoes or soak garbanzo beans for falafel, it isn't as if we spend our day hovering over the pot. We get on with our day while the water does its work.. Cutting to the chase, I was wrong. Yes, this and all pressure cookers primarily just cook faster, but it is surprising how much that changes the game. Many foods no longer require planning. You can start cooking when hungry. You can cook dinner at dinner time rather than starting hours earlier.. I just steamed 11 uncut potatoes (to be mashed) in 15 minutes! When making baby food, I steamed carrots and broccoli in 3 minutes of cook time!. Some specific observations:. - Cook times listed in various recipes do not include warm-up time and depressurization time.. This isn't as significant as it sounds. The Instant Pot requires very little water to do its work, so it heats surprisingly quickly. I haven't timed it, but starting with cold tap water, it seems to take 1-5 minutes depending on the amount.. - Depressurization is very easy and safe, but loud. The steam shooting out of the vent isn't particularly hot, nor is it particularly flush with moisture. On our first use, I was concerned that what appeared to be a large volume of steam would collect on the cabinets, but after a few seconds they were dry. I have no concerns about accidental steam burns because it just isn't hot enough to burn before your body can respond. I suspect the vent somehow mixes outgoing steam with cool air from the room.. - Clean-up is very easy. We rarely use our food processor because there are so many parts to clean -- it's usually overall faster to chop small batches by hand. With the Instant Pot, we have only had to clean the stainless steel bowl that ships with the unit. It is dishwasher-safe, unlike many plastic food processor parts which get cloudy and brittle after repeated washes in hot detergent water, and it is surprisingly easy to clean by hand. Because of the way the cooker works, many recipes are such that food doesn't burn onto the metal surface."},

I was eating out all the time and we all know what that can do to your budget. Read the instructions, do the water test just to get accustomed to how it works. If you read them while distracted you wont notice you set the delayed timer and not the cook timer and you will be unimpressed with the thing... until you notice your mistake and then you will fall in love.. You prep all the food and most things you would do like browning meat will be done in the pot, not on the stove. -1 dish there. You toss all the things into the pot, close the lid and set the time. *At this point you have a dirty cutting board and knife, maybe a measuring cup or two. You wait for the pot to heat up until the time starts counting down. *So this time will be added to the cooking time, it all depends on the amount in the pot.. The think kicks on and starts the cooking. I made a full pot of chicken stew in less than 1 hour.. Once it beeps let it cool for a bit or just pop the release valve. It will hiss and steam will come out. Caution Hot.. Clean up is simple, food is tasty, easy to use even if you miss a spot in the directions but don't do that.. To make this even more amazing.

I\u2019ve had for 3 weeks easy to sleep on, don\u2019t really notice it.. The issue that I have is that my little puppy had an accident and having small drips here and there the urine went straight through to my super nice mattress. The mattress is stained and smells like urine. It\u2019s kinda hard to replace a 800$ mattress. The product wasn\u2019t waterproof. I might as well have laid more blankets.. Really disappointing.

It is important to note that proper washing ensures the durability and effectiveness of the product.  My 4 yo has not had any issues thus far in the bedwetting department, but I will update my review if/when that happens."},

We have it on our King bed, and it has saved our mattress more times than I can count. It is so quiet, and breathes really well. If it is really saturated, and is left on the mattress for a long time, it will eventually become moist on the back (because it is meant to be a little breathable so you don't feel like you are sleeping on plastic), but it has to be for a really long time. I loved having this mattress protector on my own king bed so much that we put them on all 7 mattress that we have in our vacation rental house, and it has proven its worth there as well.

I should have heeded the reviews and stuck with the premium version. There's a vast difference in the quality between the two. The premium version feels less plasticky than the classic one and doesn't sound like rustling plastic whenever you shift around on your mattress. The classic version feels like polyester both inside and outside, while the premium version is polyester on the inside and has this nice fabric feel on the outside that prevents it from rustling. The premium one is also much softer."},

Not like old fashion pressure cookers that you fear would explode or injure. This has many safety features built in that keep you from harm. There are endless amounts of recipes or even jarring uses for this too. It cuts down on cooking and wait time by hours. The food taste amazing.. UPDATE 3.30.2017 I originally gave this 5 stars. But after only a handful of uses the device now seems to have  stopped functioning. It will not build up pressure. I have read numerous articles on this issue and many claim it just needs cleaning. The device is very clean and yet doesn't build up pressure. I have ruined 2 pasta dinners  after it failed to build pressure  and had to spend alot of time trying to clean the pot after it burned to the bottom of the pot. Last evening we tried it one more time cause we wanted to make cheese and grits for an office party the next day. It was late and we figured it would take 10 mins in the pressure cooker. Nope, again it failed to build pressure and burnt to the bottom of the pot.  If this device is only good for a few uses it's needs to be taken off the market."},

When you sautee you need to be very careful that it's completely de-glazed, otherwise the burn warning goes off no matter how much water you add for the pressure cook... then you add so much water that any sauce or broth is watered down!. The lid smells.  It reeks,  It cannot be helped. I used practically boiling water to clean it.  I removed the seal, the pressure cover, the steam cover.  All of it.  Soap, soaking in vinegar, everything.  Walked into our kitchen and when I walked past it smelled foul.  Nope.  If I have to go through that just to clean it, then the time savings to pressure cook is just not worth the exchange for a watered down flavor.. THUMBS DOWN- over-hyped.  Sending it back today and getting a multi-cooker!. UPDATE- as we were packaging up to return... discovered a CRACK on the lid!  We have had our slow cooker for at least 15 years!

Let Me Count the Ways....", "review_body": "The Instant Pot 7 in 1 Duo is the latest generation Instant Pot, and my THIRD Instant Pot!  Did I NEED this one?  Not  r e a l l y, but I sure did WANT it!!  It has so many brilliant features that it always seems to be on the counter. While we had one recipe in the pot, it always seemed to there was something that we could have ready to go if only we had another stainless steel inner liner.  Because my husband is equally addicted, shortly after that came the second pot, The Smart Pot.  The differences in the 7 in 1 Duo pot and the first pot, The Lux, are VAST--. I no longer have to wonder where to put a hot lid. It fits conveniently into the slots on either side on the handles. The MULTI-TEMPERATURE cooking levels ensure perfectly cooked EVERY time, including the SAUTE button that can be used to sear meats or saute vegetables. Here is a quick list of some of our favorite food, for which we faithfully use our Instant Pots regularly. And by that, I mean daily!. Stocks and broths from scratch\u2022 Soup from scratch\u2022 Quinoa in one-minute\u2022Steel cut oats, 3 minutes\u2022 Hard-boiled eggs there are easy to peel and come out perfectly every time\u2022Thai Congee\u2022Chilis of numerous varieties\u2022Frozen chicken/meat, etc., which turns out fork-tender\u2022Whole winter squash!.   I've learned an enormous amount from the authors who sell pressure cooker books on Amazon. Jill Nussinow is one of them. When I  contacted her asking a few questions, imagine my surprise when she wrote right back to me! Laura Pazzaglia is another not only legendary author but, also a knowledgeable person about all things Instant Pot.  After you purchase your Instant Pot and are feeling lost- don't hesitate to contact cookbook authors..   I don't work for Instant Pot or these authors. I do derive great joy from all three, however!"},

You can use it as a pressure cooker as well as a slow cooker! Saves time and dishes because you can saute then cook in the same pot. It has a rice button, a soup button, you can even make homemade yogurt in it (there's a button for that, too!) There are so many recipes out there in books and online, you should never run out of options! My favorite thing to make in it is mashed potatoes! You can cook the potatoes and use a hand mixer right in the pot when they're done! This wonderful little gadget not only saves on time, but also saves on clean up because you don't need to wash as many dishes, and saves on space because it is so many things rolled into one!

Just put ingredients in- set the time- and go about your business.  When the time is up, It automatically sets to warm.. Keep in mind that it only goes to about 11-12 psi.  That hasn't been an issue for me but I guess it would for canning (should be 15 psi).. This is my first electric pressure cooker and I look forward to using it every day.  My husband asks me what am I going to put in the pot for dinner today, everyday!. I even made hard boiled eggs to perfection.. After I make a roast (a frozen roast in 45 minutes and it falls apart), I will remove the roast and let it rest.  In the meantime I will put my veggies in the broth from the roast, set it for 9 minutes.  What a time saver.. I normally don't eat pork until I got this pressure cooker.  Pork falls apart!. I do wish Instant Pot would come out with an 8 quart.. Do yourself a favor and order an extra pot insert and a lid.. One con would be the rubber seal picks up an odor from everything you make.  I wash it each time I use it and store it outside of the pot.. I haven't used this to it's full potential yet, so I will update with more results."},

I was almost too late to exchange it. (I also read other reviewer's who said they had similar problems with nonfunctioning units, which is why I wanted to test every function.  This admittedly takes several hours.)  Other than that, it makes perfect, fluffy brown rice, although not with the preset rice button.  (The rice button is only for regular white rice.)  I thought the stainless cookpot might be a problem cleaning after using the pressure cooker function, but it's not. Overall, I really like the various functions as it has made it somewhat easier for my husband to use it, as well. I do find, however, that we both need the manual to remember how to operate it for our recipes, as many do not conform to the preset function buttons.  Also, I have to remember to be very careful when releasing the steam to do it very slowly and to avoid reaching directly over the unit (which is my first instinct), or I get scolded. Nevertheless, I would buy it again without hesitation."},

Well, my bathroom is done in black and white so I was looking for a scale that would fit in.  Even though you never see it, except for a few seconds at a time when it's in use, it's still nice.  For the price, it's great.  I love the glass top, it's nice and thick and I don't feel like I'm going to break it when i take it out and put it back. It sits easily on my tile floor, and quickly and accurately displays my weight.. Now, this doesn't work well on carpet (unless you're trying to lose weight, then it works great), and accuracy is an issue if you're unfamiliar with digital scales in general.  First, you really should tap the center top (right under the display, I use my foot...) to zero the scale out and turn it on, THEN step on with your feet centered and stay still until it flashes your weight.  If you just jump on, jump off, and have your feet and balance all over the place like you're jumping off a roof as Liam Neeson looking for his family, then it's going to be inaccurate as any scale would be..

Each roll comes with 90 sheets and they last me quite a long time. I can go over a month on one roll. I am being extra conservative, but these are great quality.. NOTE: Like some other reviewers have mentioned, there is some fuzz that leaves a white fuzz residue. I don't use this paper towel to clean windows or mirrors because it leaves a trail.

But I'm deducting a star for two reasons, and I hope the manufacturer will take note. The major reason is that the metal edges around the inside of the lid, especially where they stick out (see photo), were not properly buffed out and had some very sharp edges. I got two small cuts on my fingers from them. Nothing serious, but this should NEVER happen in a product like this. It's a problem on the line. Second, the silicon gasket that seals the lid has a very strong, chemical smell out of the box. We have many silicon appliances, and I've never noticed anything like that. Washing in hot water and the \"trial run\" they suggest took care of it. But it makes a very bad first impression when you think that something with such a nasty smell is going to be intimately connected to a hot, high pressure cooking process. I emphasize that we are very happy with the purchase and with what we have prepared so far. This would be a 5-star review if not for the points I have raised."},

{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "No longer the product it once was", "review_body": "I've been an Instant Pot owner and user since the first ones were offered for sale in ~2014.  We really liked our first IP but we replaced it in 2015 when the Duo model was introduced in order to take advantage of some of its new features.  That IP lasted for two years and we used it a lot, both as a pressure cooker and as a slow cooker.  In September 2017 our Duo failed and we replaced it with the then current model which was known as V2 (version 2).. It didn't take very long for us to realize that something was wrong with our V2 Duo because it couldn't Slow Cook.  It would try but the temperature of the liquid in the pot was in the 150-160 degree range rather than 180-200 range.  After discussion with IP customer service, the pot was replaced with a new V3 model in January.. Unfortunately, the V3 IP appears to have the same or worse problems as did the V2 it replaced.  Our efforts to use it as a pressure cooker have resulted in \"Burn\" warnings for recipes we've used for years without problems.  Unfortunately, it also appears to be useless as a slow cooker.  Today I nearly ruined a simple pot roast because after 3 hours the slow cook function stopped heating even though the control panel showed that operations were normal.. I'm sure that the folks at IP will offer me a new pot; frankly, at this point I just want my money back. In the past 6 months I've ruined quite a few dinners because of cooking failures.  This is totally unacceptable and I hate to have to hover over my cooking utensil to ensure that it is working correctly.  If I can get my money back I'm going to buy a Breville.  Yes, it costs more but in this case I think you may well get what you pay for!"},

Or cook for full 24 hours for the most heath benefits.. The full 24 hour yogurt cycle (standard setting) cooks off the rest of the sugars and develops billions and billions of super probiotic bacteria, that tastes like heaven! So creamy and delicious!.

I purchased two sizes for my own use: the mini 3-quart (which is my almost-every-day work horse for 2 person dishes) and the 8-quart (which I bring out to handle my dinner party dishes). I have also purchased no less than 5 Instant Pot recipe books, and everything I\u2019ve tried has been fabulous. In the realm of kitchen appliances, there is no better investment than the Instant Pot. My hat\u2019s off to the inventors of this amazing appliance. Highly recommended!!!"},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Fuse died after warranty expiration. No replaceable fuse!!", "review_body": "So, I loved using my previously purchased Instant Pot, but it died after 2 years.  The company told me it sounded like a blown fuse.  Unfortunately, they use a proprietary screw to access the fuse and I would not be able to change it myself.  Therefore, they recommended I purchase a new Instant Pot.  To make the new purchase less painful, the company\u2019s representative said she would send me an invoice to my email address with a small price reduction.  Yet, I never received the invoice.  She told me to check my junk folder (but it wasn\u2019t there).  The funny thing is that the customer service rep could send me emails each day and I would receive them.  But, whenever she would send me an email with the reduced-price invoice, it would, mysteriously, not make it to me.  I suspect she was just testing my patience (and she won).  I ended up paying full price for a new Instant Pot.. In short, the product is awesome, but the company appears to have a greed component.  The Instant Pot is definitely well-made and should stand up to many years of use\u2014if not for the fuse that\u2019s designed to fail right after the warranty expires.  If you can\u2019t tolerate this type of behavior from a company, then don\u2019t buy this product.  Otherwise, be prepared to buy a new Instant Pot every couple of years (like me)."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Best Appliance I have ever owned especially in our RV", "review_body": "I have used a pressure cooker most of my married life (50+ years) but this is the best one I have ever had. No worry about the pressure being too high or too low because you can't get the stove heat adjusted just right. We live in an RV and having an appliance do more than one job is absolutely essential when you have a lack of storage space. I was able to get rid of my slow cooker and my pressure cooker and replace them both with this marvelous pot! This past weekend we went to a potluck and I made deviled eggs - using 2 dozen eggs. The one part of preparing the eggs is the hardboiling of them and the peeling. Most of the time the eggs do not peel well. This time I steamed them in the Instant Pot and they cooked beautifully and peeled with no problem. Every egg was perfectly cooked and peeled. If I didn't use it for anything else, it was well worth the price. I will be using it for lots of other cooking lots of other things. I have used the rice cooker and it makes wonderful and tasty rice that is not mushy or undercooked. I have cooked chicken and pork in it using both the slow cooker and the pressure cooker selections. I have not been disappointed with any the recipes I have cooked. I would definitely recommend purchasing one."},

I suck at remembering to take things out to defrost, so it's perfect for me. So far I made (in one pot) pork chili verde burritos, chicken and rice casserole, bbq shredded chicken sandwiches, and lastnight, a frozen solid pot roast! No joke, frozen pot roast turned into falling apart delicious goodness with potatos and carrots in 90 mins! It seriously took 4 mins to cook the potatos and carrots. Frozen chicken from costco in 15 mins. Ive  had almost no dishes to do all week long. It's friggin awesome. Can't say enough good stuff about it. I have a family of 3, but i bought the 8 quart, because i make leftovers for my husbands lunch the next day. And im so glad i got the bigger one. It's huge very large (about the size of a new wave oven) but worth the extra space you get inside. I could see myself being dissapointed  if I would have gone with the 6quart. Because you can only fill it up 2/3 of the way. All in all great buy, I'm giving away my crockpot. Makes food 10x better and faster. Also one thing to mention, is cabinets... when you push back the vent switch, there is alot of steam. I knew there was steam before I bought it ( thanks to schooling myself on YouTube videos before it arrived in the mail) but I was not aware of how much steam, and that it shoots out steam for a while. First time I used it, I pulled it away from my cabinets, but it still shot right up and got them wet with steam. Anyway, so I wanted to pre warn anybody, to make sure before you buy this that you have a place for it that is not directly over wood cabinetry. Anyway, good luck with your new purchase! Best gift I've ever gotten."},

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Superior to standard paper towel in my opinion, but the quality has gotten worse over time.", "review_body": "I've been using Viva paper towel for years. It always felt the most like cloth--it was incredibly absorbent and soft, came off the roll very easily, and was overall very pleasant to use. I prefer it by far to other kinds of paper towel.. However, starting a while back (I don't remember--maybe 6 months or more) the product began changing.. 1. The paper towel was tighter on the roll so you had to actually peel each piece off, and you often need to use both hands to do it or you might end up just ripping small bits off of the roll.. 2. The reason they rip more easily might be because the pieces feel a bit thinner and weaker. This is hard to quantify without having an old roll to compare, but they don't hold up quite as well for me.. 3. They feel rougher to the touch. That soft cloth feeling just wasn't the same.. 3. When I use them on or near my face, I notice that they now smell slightly of acetic acid (like vinegar), which is a scent I'm particularly averse to.. I haven't found another brand that I like as much as I used to like the old VIVA paper towels, but I'm starting to wonder if I'd be better off switching brands now that VIVA paper towels are not so nice anymore.. I keep holding out hope that they will return to their former quality, but as time goes on that seems less and less likely. I can't decide if it's worth lowering to 3 stars or not but have decided to leave it at 4 for now. They're still my preferred paper towel, there's just a lot to complain about that didn't used to be the case."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Favorite household paper product", "review_body": "It seems like there is a premium version of every household product these days.  Raw organic dog food, heated toilet seats, that brand name boar bristle hair brush, Norwex dust cloths, diamond-encrusted electric toothbrushes with 13 modes and a tongue massager\u2026 We splurge on some of these and on others we definitely don\u2019t.  One of our splurges?  These paper towels.. I purchased them for the first time in 2012 on a whim.  I had no idea you could fall so hard for paper towels and immediately became a loyal customer. Fast forward 6 years and we\u2019re now a family of 5 plus dog, and we go through a crazy number of paper towels.  As a result, it got harder to justify the higher price and, over the years, I\u2019ve occasionally tried going back to a cheaper brand.  I regretted it every time.. Here\u2019s a little cost-benefit breakdown on these paper towels for others who struggle with the higher price point like I did:. - Baby\u2019s face covered in pureed peas? 1 sheet.. - Baby who loves getting his face cleaned with these super soft paper towels?  Priceless.. - Toddler gallops through the kitchen with a runny nose? 1 sheet.. - Quickly grabbing a paper towel gentle enough for his nose, rather than running for a tissue while toddler spreads cold germs to siblings?  Priceless.. - Any one of our four dependents has an accident on the floor?  No one\u2019s counting sheets here.. - Thick, durable paper towels providing an effective barrier between my hands and bodily fluids?  Priceless.. - Husband spills his humungous bottle of craft beer (again)? 6 sheets (seriously, these bottles are huge).. - Sticky mess quickly averted with highly absorbent paper towels and marital bliss restored?  Priceless.. - Sitting down for family dinner and need napkins?  5 sheets.. - Not buying paper napkins?  Legitimate cost savings!. Ok, I\u2019m not necessarily saying these premium paper towels will save you money, but they can absolutely save your sanity.  The fact that they\u2019re softer and thicker than most paper towels makes them our go-to paper product for just about everything.  One thing they\u2019re not great at?  As other reviewers have mentioned, they leave lint on glass and other surfaces you polish.  I\u2019ve also found that because they\u2019re really absorbent, they tend to soak up a lot of cleaning product rather than spread it around.  For those jobs?  See the aforementioned Norwex cloths (thanks, Mom!)."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "So weird...", "review_body": "I agree with the other reviewers! What on Earth is up with these towels? Forget one-handed use. It takes very careful and meticulous work to get each sheet loose from the roll. Once it\u2019s loose, it tears in the most random place and you end up with wads of tiny paper. Also the lint is pretty annoying. I don\u2019t like paper towels that are super loose either but the degree that these are stuck so tight almost seems like a smart-alek response to customers\u2019 need for a tighter roll. Lol!"},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Not bad overall, but not for me", "review_body": "Let me first say that as paper towels go, these are very durable and absorbent.  And they do the job quite well.  My issue with them is using them in a countertop towel dispenser, which is very difficult.  The problem is that the towels stick to themselves and are very difficult to unwind.  Even when manually unwinding the next towel from the roll I would often tear the towel in the process.  It was that \"stuck\" to the roll.  In other words a towel dispenser is virtually useless apart from giving the roll a place to reside without falling over.. So I am going to go back to my Bounty paper towels that may not be as \"good\" but are far friendlier and easier to use at least in my case."},

These are select a sheet style and are decent quality and durable. They also clean and absorb well.

I'm not sure if it's because they're 'Choose-a-Sheet' or because they changed the structure, but they're slightly thinner and courser than they were (we had some of the former 'like cloth' to compare them to).

Get a cloth unless you want to use half a roll of Viva, and even then, the surface will still be damp.

In fact I there is not much more that I could add to this review that hasn't already been said,. The functionality of this is pretty simple and straightforward. The cookbook that comes with this is pretty generic but will get you started on some simple items.. I have found numerous websites devoted to the use of the instant pot and many great gluten free recipes.. This will cook food fast as it says it will. One thing to note, you need to allow time for the first initial heat up before the timer starts. If you  get ahead of the book and skip over parts you might miss that part like I did. I thought something was wrong and it wasn't working. Just wait and the timer will start. It took mine 15 minutes to heat up the first time. Now I know.. Also a note about cooking gluten free pasta. You will have to adjust your water or moisture content. You will have to use less water than what is called for or you will have a mushy mess. Most gluten free recipes containing pasta will tell you what and how much to add. Do that and then tweak your own recipes,. You will love it and enjoy it once you have learned how to use it. Enjoy!.

It works as described in the many online articles singing its praises. Ive been using it for speedily cooking chili, excellent rice, steel cut oats, and stews.

Mainly because the crock pot would overcook anything put in it even on low, especially if it was anything under 100% full.

I've been cooking for years and am pretty good at it, but have been getting bored, too busy etc etc - you know all the excuses one uses to \"run out of time\" so we must simply go out and get something from Taco Bell (Or fill in your favorite fast food restaurant).  Anyway, I had never even seen a pressure cooker in real life.  A few of my favorite bloggers (Paleo Parents, Nom Nom Paleo to name two right off the bat) had mentioned this wonderful device, but I didn't really take much notice of it b/c a) the cost and b) no frame of reference.  Then my dear mother asked me if I wanted one.  She had been reading about them and offered me one for Christmas.  I said SURE! (who wouldn't?)  It came.  Now what?  I started googling \"how to cook with the Instant Pot\" and found many websites and recipes to be very helpful.  I printed off a recipe, (read the manuals first of course) and started with Chicken and Dumplings.  AMAZING and FAST and DELICIOUS!  I was intrigued.  I bought Bob Warden's two cookbooks:  Great Food Fast and Slow Food Fast, and also Hip Pressure Cooking (I love real books)  I devoured those for techniques, tips etc and then I joined Instant Pot Community on Facebook.  I have been LOVING using this device.  I love to peruse the cookbooks, print off recipes from the Community, and then go to town.  It is so easy, the instructions are clear, there is plenty of help out there and everything I have made so far has turned out to be absolutely delicious!  I can even cook meat from frozen (a huge seller for me - read the first sentence!  I'm not always great at planning ahead)  Now I can pull out a recipe, put it on the table in a short time and know I'm feeding my family delicious, tasty and healthy meals.  This Instant Pot is worth its weight in gold.  I've made a roast (ooh-la-la!), Porcupine Meatballs (they've never turned out before, tonight they are outstanding!), Chicken and Dumplings (none better since my Gluten free-for-all days), Chicken and Wild Rice Soup, Beef Stew, hard boiled eggs (SO easy to peel), and my whole chicken is cooking right now as I type.  (I did the porcupine meatballs before I left for work so I would have something to heat up quick for dinner before my family heads out to watch basketball games).  The chicken we will eat, then I will make a few batches of bone broth tomorrow.  I can't believe this device is making cooking fun again!.I've not tried to do more with it than pressure cooking, although someone on the Instant Pot Community (Facebook) posted something about coconut yogurt in the IP.

I don't have to stare at the pressure cooker to see when the pressure valve has popped up... I don't have to monitor the pot while under pressure to make sure the temp isn't too low or high... This machine is literally a put it in, turn it on, and leave it alone.  I find myself using it all of the time, like each day.  I cook complete meals in it, where with my stove top i just cooked up big batches of beans to later use in recipes.  I simply love the ease and convenience of this pot.. Pros... everything from timer mode, to being able to saut\u00e9 in pot before adding other ingredients, to turn it on and walk away.  I love that the inner pot is stainless steel as that is important to my cooking.. Cons... my stove top cookers are 8 and 10 quart ... this is a 6 quart.  i wish it were bigger. Good for a meal a perhaps left overs for my family, but not big batch cooking.. Tips:  Get an extra inner pot so that if you are finished cooking one thing, you can immediately put the next pot in.  This has been my way of doing big batch cooking.  I prepare both pots at the same time, and just cook one after the other.  Also get the additional glass lid, great for steaming and storage.  I also got a steamer insert basket that worked great once i took the handles off.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SPKR8U?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00. Comparison to the 6 in one Instant.  They are very similar, but the 6-1 model i received, first of all didn't work, but secondly had i had a working model, the lid isn't the same.  The inside cover that protects the pop up valve is much smaller. Perhaps still a great pot, but for a bit extra i recommend the 7-1."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Love It!!", "review_body": "This is my second electric pressure cooker.  The first one worked well until the little button on the lid fell out and it wouldn't hold pressure anymore.  Over the years I've used stove top cookers and liked them ok, but after having an electric one, I felt I'd rather replace my \"broken\" one with electric rather than a stove top.  I'd been watching the infomercials on tv for another brand and was tempted to buy it, almost made the phone call, but stumbled upon the rating on Amazon, listing the Instant Pot as top rated.  I went back and read the reviews for the one on tv and while most seemed good, there were several negative ones.  The reviews for the Instant Pot were all good, and in reading nearly half of the [over] 300 reviews and finding them all positive, I decided to go with the Instant Pot even though it was more expensive.  When I got the notice that it had been shipped, I anxiously awaited it's arrival and had a pork roast ready and waiting!!  When it arrived, I went to YouTube to learn how long to cook the roast.  Most videos said about 45 minutes, so I sent the Instant Pot for 45 minutes and waited.  The first thing I noticed as it was cooking, was there was no sound and no smell.  Was It working?  I turned the release valve to Vent and sure enough, steam came out, so obviously it was working!  The no smell no sound thing could be good or bad depending on your point of view.  If you love the delicious smells of dinner cooking, your going to be disappointed, but if that's a non issue for you then it's not a problem.  At the end of the 45 minutes, I released the steam and opened the lid.  I was disappointed to find that the roast was not tender and yummy.  Fortunately, in my eagerness to try the IP out, I had started dinner early enough that I had plenty of time to run it through another 45 minutes.  After this second 45 minutes, I checked it again and still wasn't satisfied with it's doneness.  I put it on for another 30 minutes and when I opened the lid, I was Thrilled with the results!!  The fact that it ended up taking 2 hours for what I believed would take only 45 minutes was not a deterrent for me.  The roast was delicious, the vegetables I had put in after the first 45 minute go-round were done to perfection, and my husband was a very happy man that night!  From that night on, I used my Instant Pot every night for that first week.  I used it in slow cook mode twice and again found it needed extra time but did an excellent job of cooking a delicious meal.  My first electric pressure cooker had the non stick pot but in reading reviews for several brands, the requests and/or satisfaction with stainless steel pots was overwhelming, so that was one of the reasons I decided to go with the Instant Pot.  The stainless pot has a heavy, good quality feel to it and could even be used for cooking on the stove top if one wanted to do that.  I gave the Instant Pot a 5 star rating, but  would have preferred to give it 4 1/2 because of the longer cooking times required, but my stars got posted publicly before I could figure out how to do a half star.  In spite of the longer cooking times, I'm totally satisfied with the Instant Pot.  Meals take longer than they say, but still get finished much faster than cooking on the stove or oven, so I just make allowances for that extra time.  I love being able to put my food in the pot and walking away to go about my business without having to fuss with stirring and watching heat settings and all the things that go along with stove top or oven cooking.  I'm so happy with it, that I will be buying one for a wedding present for a good friend who just got married recently!  One thing I'd like to add, is that while I absolutely love the Instant Pot, I'm quite dissatisfied with the cookbook.  It's filled with things that I'm not likely to cook for my family.  While I do acknowledge that it's always fun to try new things, I'd like to see instructions for cooking more traditional things as well."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Don't be deterred by the 6 quart size. It's great for a large family!", "review_body": "I absolutely love this Instant Pot. I can make 2 dozen steamed (hard boiled) eggs that peel like a dream every time. It makes the most perfect baked potatoes. I made the most delicious stew that tasted like it had been simmering for hours. I was really disappointed that I couldn't find one with a larger capacity as we have a very large family. However, I discovered that the quick cooking makes it ideal for making a large meal. I made a very large corned beef roast the other day. I was able to cook the roast in the liquid first. Then I took the roast out and covered it with foil. I filled the IP completely with potatoes and carrots in the same juice the roast had cooked. They came out tasting just like I had made the entire thing together. This was a huge bonus because I usually can't fit very many potatoes and carrots around a roast in the crock pot. I ended up with at least double the sides for my family than can be accomplished in a crock pot. Unfortunately, I couldn't fit all of the extra cabbage on top. Not a worry. Only a minute by itself in the IP with the juice and I had an entire head of cabbage to go along with the rest. I truly love it!. Some of the reviews posted complaints about it not working or coming to pressure after the warranty had expired. Amazon offers a very reasonable extended warranty. I purchased one with this item to ensure that I wouldn't be out the money I invested if it should fail in the next two years."},

I contacted Instant Pot and they want pictures of the ring inside.  If it is the ring then that reflects how cheaply this is made since I had used it only 8 times.  I tried to make brown rice and it's not doing anything.  I'm frustrated because we are beyond the return period through Amazon."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Much Better Than Stove-Top Cookers", "review_body": "I've been using this pressure cooker for about a month now, and I love it.  It is nicely made and high quality.  The interior pot is good, heavy stainless steel.  The saute option works better than I expected.. It did take a couple of tries for me to learn how to use the buttons correctly (specifically, the adjust one), but now that I am doing it right, I don't understand why I had a problem to begin with.  It is simple.  Apparently, I don't understand simple.. I've cooked ribs in beer for for my husband, lemon garlic chicken, various soups, brown rice, and various beans.  Do note that the \"rice\" setting is for white rice, not brown, but my rice cooked beautifully with a manual setting.  As a vegetarian, I cook lots of beans and grains, and this pot makes it so easy.  I don't have to plan hours in advance.. I cooked split pea soup (I know some of you are saying \"ewwwww!), and split peas are notorious for foaming.  I added a bit of oil to the pot and used two cups of split peas plus 1/4 cup of hulled barley, and the pot handled it beautifully.  The lid opens and locks easily, and the release value is easy to use if you are using a quick release.. I used to make my own yogurt but haven't done that for awhile.  However, this pot has a yogurt setting, so I'm going to try making my own again.. The high setting seems to have a lower psi than some stove-top pressure cookers, but that is not a problem for me.  I had a stove-top cooker that I used a few times, and got rid of.  It didn't set on my glass-top stove as evenly as it should so didn't work well, and it was hard to get the right temperature for the pot.  This electric one works much, much better for me.. Cleaning the little seal ring and getting the lid dry is a bit of a bother, but I think that is the nature of pressure cookers.  The recipe booklet could be more helpful than it is, but I've been checking out library pressure cooker cookbooks while deciding which I want to buy.  There is a chart of times for various meats, grains and beans, and vegetables, which is handy,. The pot comes with a little rack and a couple of utensils and a measuring cup made of plastic.  Because you are probably smarter than I am, you probably will not turn the pot to \"saute\" before taking out the utensils.  Bye-bye, little plastic measuring cup.  Fortunately, I noticed before I caused any real damage.. I wanted a pressure cooker, but now that I have one, I am using it more than I expected to.  And for me, electric is the way to go."},

I would possibly rate it five stars if I had some known test weights for calibration, but I think this is 'weigh' better than an old dial type mechanical scale, and not very expensive, either."},

The material feels like a $2 beach towel I would buy at CVS while on vacation because I forgot to pack an actual one. It\u2019s also a touch noisy. I\u2019ll pray that I can just put a fitted sheet on top of it and hope it solves my problems.

If it will protect that well against stinky cat pee than it should hold up against just about anything.. The top fabric is very nice, a softer terry cloth type finish and it doesn't crinkle at all like you might expect a plastic mattress pad to.

I really like how thin it is, because we don't notice it over our sleep number mattress, and it doesnt crinkle or make noise at all (yay). I also haven't had to readjust it over the mattress since we put it on, which is frankly amazing. I would definitely buy it again for other beds.

It has a nice terry cloth top side which is soft, unlike some protectors I've felt before.

First let me say,  I've used and owned a wide variety of pressure cookers (PC's) over the past 40+ years from the lowly Presto, a Fagor, All American canner and all the way up to the Mercedes of PC's the wonderful Kuhn Rikon Duomatic in a 5 qt and a 12 qt models.  I have owned 8 qt. electric PC's also but after they died young with flaked off and nasty teflon coated interiors that I was constantly replacing I swore I would NEVER buy another electric PC!  NEVER!  Well, a friend was convinced I didn't know what I was missing from not owning an Instant Pot with their s/s interior pot.  Since I have spent a truck load of money on these PC's over the years I could not believe this cooker could be any better than all the others.  Boy was I wrong!. The iPot is multi-functional, predictable and forgettable until you hear the beep!  I bought the 8 qt. because my two best PC's are 5 and 12 quarts.  The 5 being almost too small for two people and the 12 quart way too big for weeknight meals for two people so what I wanted was an 8 qt size and when I saw the introduction of the 8 qt. I leaped for it.  I have started making foods in this cooker I never even tried again after my first few unpleasant experiences in trying to cook them in the stove top models; i.e., rice, beans, veggies and  boiled EGGS for breakfast!  Who would have ever thought it could be so easy and CONSISTENT every single time and even produce boiled eggs that my husband likes in ONE MINUTE - soft and runny - just how he loves them every single time I make them.  I've also endeavored to learn to cook more meals in the iPot because I've learned that I can rely on the eventual outcome.  I must admit I've only used the slow cooking setting once.  I'm not too great at planning ahead so my go to first method of cooking is the pressure setting.  I've enjoyed the sauteed setting and the ability to do almost every step right in the PC because of the big s/s pan.  I've been rethinking the cooking process so I can cook the pasta, drain, keep warm and build the rest of the sauce/ingredients and return the pasta to the sauce for a one pot meal.  What a lovely helpmate this iPot has become. Less work, less clean up when the meal is finished and a perfect outcome.  Hooray!. I'm thrilled with this purchase and I hope this countertop miracle worker will keep on puffing and cooking those meals for years to come!  So glad I was one of the first people to buy the 8 qt, even if I did pay more money for it (LOL) than what it is selling for now!"},

This Instant Pot makes tender, spicy carnitias every time.  Make sure to use a pork butt, as we've found it is the tenderest cut of port there is.  This also works great for homemade soups and broth.  Bone broth, and homemade chicken soup are so nourishing and have made a come-back.

The downside is, very few recipes for the mini and I am not courageous enough to alter the 6qt recipes. quite yet, but I will experiment some. The little cookbook that comes with it has some strange meals I would never like. Instruction manual is good, it took a few tries to make my Jasmine rice perfect, but I got it!  It is easy to use once you practice a little.  I did make some awesome shredded Mexican beef in it too.  Like all the bloggers say about these Instant Pots, don't give up and keep experimenting. I did buy extra rings to have on hand, that was good advice from some others.  There is a little colander bowl that fits perfectly in the 3qt for steaming you can buy here  on Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BR4GWN2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1.

I have yet find a recipe where things all cook together and come out right. the soups I make take just as long on the stovetop, usually with less steps.

I want to say that I bought another brand for 1/2 the price from QVC.  I liked it, but it wasn't real good quality, the pot was non-sick, and we all know non-stick wears out.  Due to other issues, I returned the cheap one to QVC and bought this one.. I LOVE THIS INSTANT POT!!  I didn't want to spend the money, but after reading the reviews I decided to buy it and I am so glad I did,  I want to say the quality of the Instant Pot is superb.  I really like the stainless steal pot.  It is good quality, plus it has a heavy plat on the bottom.  I can really tell the difference from the cheap one.  I would buy this again in a NY minute!  I've made pot roast in it in about an hour.  I made tomato sauce w/no meat in 5 min.  The rice comes out perfect.  The other night I decided to put an oven roast in it.  It was 4 1/2 lbs and may still have been a little frozen in the middle.  I put it in for 30 min.  the inside was only 40 deg., so I put it in for another 30 min and it read 150 deg.  I let it rest and put the duo pot on saut\u00e9 and made my gravy.  When I sliced my roast it was perfectly pink all the way thru and is delicious!!  I haven't tried to yogurt yet, or slow cook or steam, but everything I cook comes out great.  I am getting ready to try my cheesecake in it.. I also highly recommend the following book:. Hip Pressure Cooking: Fast, Fresh, and Flavorful Hardcover  - September 2, 2014 by Laura D.A. Pazzaglia  (Author). She explains everything, plus gives the time for stovetop and electronic.  She also has done a video on the Instant Pot.  I have a stove top pressure cooker, buy never mastered it.  I have an electric stove and with the stovetop cooker, you have to get 2 burners going.  Once your pot comes to pressure, you have to have a 2nd burner at low heat and transfer it over.  The only problem is you have to babysit it to make sure it stays at pressure.  Just too much trouble for me.  That is why I use the Instant Pot all the time.  NO BABYSITTING!!!!. ALSO:  I just wanted to mention that it is normal for steam to escape when you are bringing it up to pressure.  My cheap one didn't mention it in the manual and I thought it was broken and sent it back to QVC, but I am so glad I did because this is much nicer.  I can feel the difference, even the way the lid locks in.  You will not be disappointed if you buy this.  It is well worth every penny (although I wish it was cheaper)."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I love this thing.", "review_body": "I've had my Duo60 for almost a month now and I love it.  Before getting it I made sure to read up on recipe ideas, how they differ from standard stove top pressure cookers, and I watched every video I could find on the subject.  I tend to do that with every kitchen product I buy so I know if I really want it beforehand, and what mistakes to avoid after it arrives.. Tonight as a last minute dinner idea I tossed in 4 frozen solid chicken legs and thighs, poured in some soy sauce, vinegar and Mirin; pressed the poultry button; and twenty-something minutes later I had perfectly cooked and flavorful Adobo.  Without my Instant Pot it probably would have been fast food instead."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "This thing really is awesome!", "review_body": "All right, I rarely write a review, but this Instant Pot is too awesome not to add to the already incredibly convincing reviews about it.. I just receive my IP-DUO08 (the big one) last Thursday night.  Friday I cooked rice in it as the first thing...came out great.  Then I had 3 frozen chicken breasts, so I busted those out and did 'em up after the rice.  I've never had such perfectly cooked, hot (heat hot), tender and juicy chicken breasts.  And that was just for starters.... So then on Saturday I bought a 4.5 pound chuck roast.  I seared it up first just as you see people do it on the youtubes.  Just look up \"Instant Pot\" and whatever you want to cook, like \"pot roast\" or \"chile\", etc.  I seasoned it up w/ all the regular stuff...nothin' fancy...everyone will use whatever they like to use, so do your thing, it will all come out great in the end.. Then I set it on the high pressure meat setting along w/ 2 big chopped sweet yellow onions and let it go for about 35 mins.  After that I released the pressure and opened it up.  All was cooked great already, but then I added chopped up yellow skin taters and carrots which was all I had handy at the time.  Closed it back up again for another 15 mins.. I basically turned it into a big stew...and it turned out fantastic.  So easy and only took about 90 mins along w/ prepping time to clean and cut up everything first.. So today, since all the \"stew\" had already been wiped out, I seasoned and seared up 2 huge pork tenderloins.  Did same thing as with the chuck roast...pressure cooked them w/ a couple more onions for 35 mins, then opened it up again and added in all the rest of the carrots, onions, and taters I still had left over from before that I didn't use w/ the roast.. However...with the pork tenderloins I added in 3 cups of Mojo marinade to give it that Mojo flavor kick.  This was awesome...you all gotta do it.. Then I pressure cooked it all again for another 15 mins along w/ letting it de-pressurize naturally for about 10 mins afterwards.  Then I let out the rest of the steam pressure using the quick release valve and opened it up.. Again...absolutely amazing.  I basically created a shredded Mojo pork tenderloin stew that is incredible tasting.  Best thing I've ever made and it was only the 3rd thing I've cooked up yet w/ this pot.  I could have added all kinds of other stuff, celery, peppers, etc., but I just didn't have them at the time.  But now that I know how to use this thing w/ the basics and have the timing down, there's no limit to experimenting and cooking up great stuff.. And I do recommend getting the 8 quart size unit rather than the 6.  I have the 8 and it's just easy to tell that any unit smaller than this would make it difficult for good size stew type meals or other things like big roaster size chickens, or ribs, etc.  You gotta have the extra room for liquids and other things like lots of carrots, taters, onions, etc.  And with the 8 it seems just big enough for that kinda stuff.  I think if I had bought the 6 I would be frustrated w/ the smaller size, and there also might be more of a chance of overloading it and over pressurizing the smaller one if it's too loaded up.  Better to have the extra room in the 8 size.  Just sayin'.... Some pics are attached."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Why would you bake a pie or a cake in this thing when a regular oven works just fine? You can't possibly save any time", "review_body": "I bought this a few weeks ago, and was thoroughly intimidated by the apparent complexity and lack of information.  As one reviewer said, the manual doesn't tell you how high the cooking temperatures are or the length of various cycles.  And speaking of the manual, the manual Amazon sent shows items that don't match the pot.  The manual says to line up the arrow on the lid with the arrow on the pot and then turn counter-clockwise.  No arrows.  Had to turn clockwise to close.  My manual says in one place that selecting the function key (the food item you are cooking) will automatically set the pressure.  It doesn't.  If you want high pressure you have to also press the pressure button to raise it from low to high. It says that in a different place.. The other problem I have had is in finding recipes for items I want to cook.  I make milk braised pork shoulder ala Marcella Hazen but could only find a recipe for milk braised pork loin; I had to guess at cooking times.  The recipe book that comes with it is written for Chinese people and sometimes doesn't make sense.  I bought a recipe book, but it is full of recipes that I would never want to make.  Why would you bake a pie or a cake in this thing when a regular oven works just fine?  You can't possibly save any time.  I expect that it will be great for cooking lots of things, but the learning curve is steep.  There are blogs available that are helpful.. One thing that I give it low marks for is that it is much larger than it appears in pictures.  I thought I would be able to leave it out on the counter, but it takes up far too much room.  Luckily, I was able to rearrange one cupboard so I can put it away."},

In fact, the scale's thinness and sleek profile are it's primary positive differentiator from other scales. When you think about it- in a no-frills, baseline bathroom scale, the size and design/appearance are the only real picking point (assuming it is accurate in measuring weight). This scale does, in fact, seem accurate in its weight measurements - I will update this review appropriately if that degrades over time. This particular model scale, at this price point, unsurprisingly has no other user functions or measurement modes (like calculating BMI, for instance).

With a brand new Hybrid Memory Foam mattress from Loom & Leaf my spouse and I certainley wanted to protect it and purchasing this brand was a wise choice.. In the past we've used Sleep Tite protectors which were fine, although slept a bit hot and are twice the price so giving the SafeRest a shot was well worth doing. Some nice touches are:. * Soft Terry Top and Underside - protective material is in the middle. * Very thin. * Very well made stretch sides for any depth mattress. * Fitted Sheet Style elastic keeps the pad from shifting. * Great Price. * Breathes and does not sleep hot. Because most all mattress pads are only moisture and spill \"Resistant\" if you're looking to fully protect a new or existing mattress I look at it as a two tiered  strike. You need the full and complete stain/spill guard of a protection of pad - covered by a quality Mattress pad. We've used the Pinzon by Amazon on all our beds and they're marvelous, thick, plush and have wonderful support. In this way your mattress is both fully protected and comfy to boot.. My only gripe with the SafeRest is that it's not completely noiseless, without a top mattress pad expect to hear some crinkle but it's not obnoxious and can quickly be silenced by adding a plush mattress pad on top as suggested above. That said, the company was  fast to respond with a helpful tip which you can see under comments - Because packaging is so tight and it is, this saves space and reduces packaging  waste which I appreciate. After washing the Terry Loops will loosen up a bit and eliminate any noise.. Highly recommended."},

I dump in some rice and spices, or beans, press a few buttons, and move on with my life until the machine beeps.

Get ready to spend on accessories: I like a second liner pot ($35) the glass lid for saut\u00e9ing, a better base riser than it came with, as well as a stainless steamer basket. Also find that a silicone steamer with \"feet\" and \"handles\" is nice as you can use that to lift things out--such as cheesecake. Yup. You'll want the 7\" dia  x 3\" high pan for that!. You can set up the delay feature for foods like steel cut oats the night before--it cooks breakfast while we get ready. You'll need to get stainless or heatproof bowls though as this requires the \"pot in pot\" technique which saves on cleanup too.. You may never need your stove again except to finish certain recipes under the broiler. I also notice so many men seem to love it--the book by two guys with 500 recipes is worth getting too.. Yes you're in for $200 or more with all the extras--but you'd spend that on a session with a psychotherapist and this will change your life much more quickly.

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "So far so good, for western and Indian food", "review_body": "so, i bought this before the black friday sale. *sad face*. but, i had owned it a month by then and used it almost every day, so i suppose i got some good value out of full price!. i was originally looking for a slow cooker with a saute option. but i didn't like any that were on offer. they either had the non stick inserts or the very heavy ceramic covered stone inserts. and in either, i just didn't like the idea of the covering chipping away and mixing in with the food being cooked. then i came across the instant pot. at first i skipped over it, because that many positive reviews just didn't seem right. there are so many products here on amazon now that have these review-for-discount ratings that bump up products that i'm more skeptical about items than i used to be (there's got to be something amazon can do about their algorithm on this). but it kept coming up in searches, etc, and my friend had been raving about her electric pressure cooker as well (not ip, just electric pressure cooker), so i decided to investigate. i went to their site, saw some other ratings and reviews on the internet and after comparing models, decided on this one. along with the pot i also bought the glass lid for use when slow cooking.. the features that made me buy this were. 1. the stainless steel insert (ALL my cookware is stainless steel, with the exception of one le creuset dutch oven and a couple of iron griddles),. 2. the saute option,. 3. the slow cook option,. 4. the pressure cook option with manual adjustment options.. now, before i delve into my review, i should make it clear that i do cook a lot, western and indian (if you're desi like me and are wondering how this fares with indian dishes, read on). along with the cookware listed above, i also have conventional pressure cookers: good ol' fashioned hawkins and prestige pressure cookers, which i have used for almost 15 years without trouble; i still have these and still use them.. one of the first things i did with this was make a slow cooked chicken soup. it did wonderfully. i was thrilled that i could set the time and adjust the heat. i also used the saute option for onions and garlic before throwing everything in and slow cooking. a note for those who may have read some reviews stating that the cooker lid doesn't work in slow cook mode and gives the \"lid\" message. to use the original lid, you have to twist the lid to close position and turn the knob to vent. i guess the electronics of the cooker detects that the lid isn't secure if you just place the cover over it and don't turn it close. i'm actually very happy that i bought the glass lid because the cooker works seamlessly with it and i can see what's going on. most of my usage in the first few days was slow cooking different soups. they turn out great and the keep warm feature keeps the food at the right temperature to serve and eat without needing to heat the food again. and it's not super hot either, which my husband prefers. five stars.. the real test of the instant pot came when using it as a pressure cooker and this is where i had to knock one star off. at first, it did great. i pressure cooked soaked raw chickpeas. perfect result. then, when i realized it was not enough for the number of people i was cooking for, i followed it up immediately with pressure cooking unsoaked chickpeas. perfect again. i mixed the two batches and you couldn't tell the difference. five stars still.. then came the chicken curry. turn on saute, throw in onions, ginger, garlic, spices, brown to perfection. good so far. now, being a veteran pressure cooker user, i have made small to large batches of chicken and meat in my hawkins and have never had to worry that the cooker is too full. with this one, as soon as the level went beyond 2/3rds, i didn't get any pressure. okay. so it's electronic, so i'll keep the five stars and make sure the level stays below the recommended level. however, even when the level is half full, there are still days when it won't build pressure. the element heats, the timer begins and ends, but no pressure. one day the level was less than half and i still had to start and stop a couple of times before i actually got pressure. by this time the food was half cooked anyway, so not quite as convenient as i would have liked.. before you say \"clean the lid and rim\", i would have you know that i clean the lid every time, as recommended in the book, removing every part as described and washing and drying them thoroughly and i also clean out the rim which, if you own this, is hard to get under. but i clean it nonetheless (because i'm a clean freak). so, i'm sorry instant pot makers, but the pressure is a little unreliable. and for many of us who cook regularly and need things that just work, this doesn't qualify for me as that quite yet. for me it's been 50/50 on the pressure cook score.. that said, when used as a slow cooker or when pressure cooking beans like chickpeas, this thing is a champion.. another note for the indian cooks: i made gaadhe aloo in this to go with kachoris. peeled and rough chopped the potatoes, briefly saut\u00e9ed the spices in the pot, threw the potatoes into the pot on slow cook, added water and left them to cook. when done, mashed up the potatoes right in the pot to create the thick gravy with chunks of potato. perfection. i haven't tried dal yet, but i will update when i do.. conclusion: i have owned this for a couple of months now and have used it a lot, almost every day. i love the convenience of it, love the slow cook and saute with adjustable options, ADORE the stainless steel insert, but only just like the pressure cooker. all in all, a good investment. so far. i would recommend."},

Speedy delivery! The product itself is better than I expected. I was a bit concerned about it being a glass scale, but it's solid. No worries about it breaking at all. It was quick to set up: simply pop in the batteries, sit it on a hard, flat surface and let the weighing begin!. I also loved the look of the scale. It is not bulky or intrusive like most scales. It's a very sleek, modern design, which is exactly what I was looking for.. So far, so good! I've only had it one day, but I love it."},

Even with moving the scale to different flat surfaces (hard wood, tile, etc) I was able to re-calibrate easily and get the same result numerous times. This scale replaced our finicky and frustrating older and more expensive scale without a second thought.

I really like the blue backlight which makes it very easy to read the numbers.. For the quality it's priced extremely well ($18.88 at the time of this review).

I labored over what to get! I spent a lot of time searching and researching multiple brands, sites, price points, style, etc., etc., etc.  I almost decided on a full-zip style cover, until I realized it would probably be a pain in the rump for me to get in on and off the mattress.  I'm really glad I came to that conclusion, and even happier that I decided on this particular protector.  This protector fits like a fitted sheet and covers my 10\" thick mattress easily with a little room to spare...yet it does not slip out of place.  It's fairly soft and flexible, so you don't really notice it once your sheet is placed over it.  I don't think it changed the feel of my mattress either.  I also love that I can just take it off my mattress, like you would a fitted sheet, and toss it in the laundry along with my other bedding.. I have recently purchased a new twin size memory foam mattress for my daughter.  Following the same logic as I did with my 1st memory foam mattress, I also wanted to purchase a protector for it.  Only this time, there was a LOT LESS searching I had to do for one!  All I had to do was look up my previous purchase from Amazon and select the appropriate size!  Yes, I liked it that much.  I now have a queen and a twin.  For anyone wondering...the twin mattress is 12\" thick and the protector fits beautifully!. The only thing I can't comment on is how well they protect against fluids.  I haven't spilled anything on my mattress...and don't exactly wish to do so just for the sole purpose of testing it.  :)"},

It is not quilted and very basic, but since it is under the sheets, no one would even know it was there.  I slept a week on it, and it never moved, lumped up, or slid around under the sheet.  There also is no crinkly sound from the plastic liner either.  It does the job and is a good foundation to keep everything in place and dry.

Years and years ago (probably 10 or 11 years ago) the product was way different, it really felt like cloth! It was soooo soft and strong, you could use it for anything! Cleaning up spills, blowing your nose, wrapping your sandwiches,  cleaning your car and even your baby! After changing the formula, making choose-a-size and printing designs, the quality is inconsistent at best, scratchy, both sides of the towels feel different, they leave lint behind, and it's been getting worse as the years pass. I wouldn't ever want to use these to blow my nose anymore, that nose would be chafed raw in 3 blows. For a long time I still bought them, trying to justify that they're still better than other brands, but I was delaying the inevitable, hoping they would get better again, and l don't think they ever will :(. Of course Kimberly-Clark will lie through their teeth about ever changing the formula in the first place. They are a corporation, they want sales, and they'll feign sympathy to try and keep the numbers up, and they'll keep peddling lower quality stuff for suckers like us to keep buying.. Please let me know if they change the formula back, or if there's another brand out there that makes a product like what these used to be!"},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Tear easy, very fuzzy, doesn't hold up well to being wet", "review_body": "I purchased these because I was having one of those couple of weeks.  My son was sick, couldn't make it into Costco (where I normally buy paper towels).  Then the AC died, and we had repair dudes in, who were awesome, but in the stress of making sure our son didn't make it out the front door I forgot to put paper towels on the list.  Twice.  And I didn't want to keep sending my husband back out, so I ordered these.  And I've got to say, I'm probably never going to do it again, but I can survive it until they are all used up.. First thing you notice when you pull these out of the box is that they are much fuzzier then most brands of paper towels.  I have attached a picture.  It's kind of like felt.  So, this is not desirable, from my perspective, if you are microwaving anything that you would use the paper towel over and don't want fibers stuck to it.  Or drying off an apple that you washed and again, don't want fibers stuck to it.. Next thing is that they tear super, super easy.  Not just when wet.  It tore two holes in the first roll I used just sliding it on our paper towel holder (it brushed up against the shorter bar of it), and this is not normally a problem I have, not with any other brand I've used.  It also comes apart easier when you are wiping up spills, which also isn't something I personally find desirable.  I need my paper towels to hold up to a lot because I am swimming in a constant sea of messes over here.  I have a very naughty kitty who's decided peeing and pooping outside of the litterbox is the world's best form of protest, his sometimes equally naughty feline sidekick, and a son who is a joy but loves to play in the sink and spill things all over pretty much everything.  So my paper towels need to not fall apart, because I use them a lot...and some of it, I don't want my fingers to come into contact with.  It's not quite as bad as toilet paper when it gets wet, but honestly, that's what it reminded me most of the way it started to come apart and turn to mush.. So, heads up. This was my experience with these in our household."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "The new kitchen necessity", "review_body": "We both work for a living.  We have 2 kids that can be picky.  Needless to say, creating meals that satisfy my family that is also healthy can be a challenge.  After buying this and using it for a few months, it is one of the most valuable tools in the kitchen.  To me, every kitchen needs a toaster, microwave, Vitamix, good set of knives, a good nonstick skillet, a cast iron pan, and some triply stainless steel cookware.  For kitchen appliances, this is the fourth most used item in our kitchen next to our toaster, blender, and microwave.. Pros. Meat comes out tender and flavorful.  We have used chicken and beef and it works wonders.  I would say it has 90% of the taste of a crock pot meal, although you can also use this as a crock pot.. Stews and harder grains are a breeze.  Cooking beans is about as foolproof as it can get once you figure out the correct settings and liquid.  You don\u2019t even need to soak the beans (although it helps).  Rice comes out as good as it does on my Zojirushi rice cooker in a quarter of the time from start to finish.  This may be the easiest method to make solid chicken stock.  You can cook smaller cuts of meat from frozen.  Harder vegetables like root vegetables cook up nice and tender.. Stainless steel bowl is generously sized and is easy to clean up.  You can put it in the dish washer with no worries other than possible discoloration.  The lid does not have any electronics so you can wash it under the sink.  Since you can take most of the unit apart, it is pretty easy to clean.  Cleaning was my biggest concern with the unit and it is quite easy.. The construction of the unit is solid.  The keep warm feature works very well.  The little pieces on the inside are also steel.  The only item I think that would possibly break would be the pressure cooker plastic relief valve.  As long as you aren\u2019t body slamming the unit, it should hold up for 3-5 years with regular use.. If you prep your meal the night before, you can have many different types of healthy, fresh, one-dish meals ready for your family in under 30 minutes.. Cons. The unit does not calculate the heat up time and depressurization time.  If the manual says chicken will take 14 minutes to cook, it is considering the time once everything is heated up and is not counting the depressurization time.  Plan accordingly.. It is a pressure cooker so it takes a while to depressurize when it is done.  Usually, it takes a minute or two if you do it manually.  If you depressurize naturally, it can take 5 minutes or so.  The fuller the unit, the longer it takes to depressurize.. The silicone ring gets discolored and absorbs smells.  You have to replace this ring once or twice a year.. The unit can get very hot to the touch.  Duh.  Keep it out of reach of little ones.. The pot is stainless steel so you are likely to get stuck on food at some point of use.. Recipes are limited.  If you don\u2019t know how to cook or experiment, you may get frustrated.. Searing in this unit is possible, but it is really weak to get a good quality sear.. Summary. Overall, I think this is an excellent unit.  Every kitchen should have one.  You can basically get crock pot food in a significantly faster time.  This unit shines with meat, soups, grains, hard veggies, and beans.  The unit will not replace every appliance in your house, but it serves its intended purpose quite well.  If I were to rank cooking appliances, you need a microwave first, then a toaster, then a good blender, then an electric pressure cooker, then a food processor, then a mixer."},

I have always made stews, pot roasts, pork for shredded pork and, well, after  forty-some odd years, I depend on a pressure cooker using one at least once a week. When I needed a new one, I checked out stainless steel stovetop on Amazon. In the \"Customers Who Viewed This Item Also Viewed\" section, I saw the Instant Pot.. The Instant Pot is everything they advertise. I will never again have to listen for the hiss-hiss to begin and then drop everything I'm doing and go adjust the electric stove knob in an attempt to get the interval of the pssst-pssst-pssst of the rocker set just right.. There are many advantages to the Instant Pot. What I've noticed so far is how much less liquid I have to use. It seems as if I need less spices. The Steam Vent handle is aafe, quick and a lot easier than picking up my old Presto stovetop PC and taking it to the dink and running cool water over it until the pressure is down and it's safe to open. Meat ends up tender, but not as stringy as that cooked in the stovetop PC. Clean up is as easy as they say. The User Interface (front panel controls and displays) are straightforward and intuitive. The handy one page reference guide is all you'll need after you've done a quick read-through of the manual.. And best of all, I won't have to depend on setting another timer or worry about mis-setting the timer, falling asleep and waking up to a Pressure Cooker run dry and have to go looking for Pressure Cookers on Amazon. Not that that's happened to me - just hypothetically speaking."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Awesome pressure cooker!", "review_body": "This thing cooks incredible ribs. Just pull the membrane back on the ribs, chop it up, toss it in the pressure cooker for 25-30 mins and then put some of that BBQ sauce on it, shove it in the oven and BROIL it for 2 mins or so on each side (to caramelize, it's already falling off the bone from the pressure cooker).  Done.  You've now just made super fast ribs that's better than what most average people can make.. Besides ribs, this thing has a host of easy to use functions like rice, beans, and you can even open the lid to sauteeing (which is what I do if I want to make some spaghetti sauce -- I would use the pot to saute up some onions, ground beef, bell peppers, mushrooms, and then dump in that good ol' Ragu/Prego sauce, season it to taste...and voila).. There's a lot more safety features and cool mechanisms with this thing so if safety is a concern, I wouldn't fret.. One thing to take note of, I recommend getting another of the silicone rubber sealant that goes on the inside of the pressure cooker lid (allows for sealing, so that the thing can pressurize properly).  It's sold here on Amazon, and also from the Instant Pot manufacturing site.  This sealant tends to develop a certain odor after awhile, and no matter how much I clean it, it's hard to get rid of.  I recommend stashing one or two extras and using those for specific groupings of food (e.g. one sealant for meats, another for soups, etc)...but then again, that's only if you're OCD like me.  I imagine most people wouldn't care because the food results you get out of this thing is sublime."},

I have adjusted the timer, always adding more minutes and results have been fine, but when you are feeding a hungry family its tough to say \"l've set it for 15 more minutes\" (on top of 35+ minutes on auto set). I keep tweaking the time and it's approaching stove top cooking. So what are the advantages? well, its self monitoring. You can set it and walk the dog. After cooking time is done, the unit goes into \"warm\" mode. It's sort of a cross between a fast crock pot and self monitoring stove top pressure cooker.  My mother had one of those old fashioned stove top pressure cookers that you prayed would never blow it's little free standing jiggling steam regulator, but she cooked up countless lip smacking fall-off-the-bone eveything meals with it. I am up to 40 minutes for a beef stew and about the same for chicken & rice. I have made both on stove top, with same flavors as a result and slightly better tenderness for the chicken. Not having to keep a close eye is the biggest advantage of this electric pressure cooker, I am still working on figuring out the the perfect cook times - its not the in the autosets! The unit is well made, has a good design, big easy to read buttons/readout, and it has various checks & balances so it's safer (it feels safer) than the stove top pressure cookers. The components are stainless steel, easy to clean & the lift-out inner pot goes from kitchen to dinner table to refrigerator. It's kind of a trade-off. Wish I could love it more."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Great Instant Pot Duo Mini--except---", "review_body": "Love my Instant Pot Duo Mini except the silicone seal on the lid.  Why does this require so much cleaning to try and keep the cooking smells out of it?  It is all over the internet about this.  You should not have to spend so much time soaking or steaming the liner to keep it from smelling.  This is a serious fault and the company really needs to fix this issue.  Now cooking in it for one or two is great (remember I have the mini).  I make yogurt, stews, flan, lemon curd, and so on without a problem.  Still use traditional pots for some things of course, but this pot is very efficient and the inner pot is very easy to clean.. So maker of the Instant Pot, get us all a seal that does not absorb the smell of whatever you are cooking.  This is a ridiculous product fault."},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "8 quarts is too large for a family of 4.", "review_body": "The 8 quart size is too large for our family of 4. I take responsibility for buying an impractical size (darn you Black Friday!). It takes 15+ minutes to get up to steaming pressure/temp, so it is not quicker or more convenient for making dinner. Perhaps if you were making larger meals, like for a party or large family, there would be less air volume to pressurize and it would cook faster. I guess it makes for less dishes to clean up. We were hoping this was a \"fire and forget\" cooking device, like a really fast Crock Pot, that would make for less kitchen work in our busy evenings, but that hasn't been our experience so far. If you have been thinking of getting one, probably because of your social media friends over-posting about their Instant Pot meals, just remember, size matters."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "But it is working really good for me", "review_body": "I read some reviews previously where some users mentioned that weight varies on scale and it is not proper. Even then I bought this product. But it is working really good for me. I will suggest to keep the scale on the flat and hard surface generally in kitchen or bathroom.  It shows me the exact weight. Product is easy to handle and nicely packed when received. Even you can change from LB to KG or vice versa."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great looking scale that is accurate to the ounce.", "review_body": "Love this scale!!! Has the nice sleek look and is accurate to the T.

I tried resetting between kilos and pounds, tried new batteries, tried a different surface in case bathroom tile wasn't level. Nothing fixed it.  Currently, its about 80lbs off, but not even that is reliable. Very disappointed since the other reviewers don't seem to have the problem."},

I see other reviews stating it didn't last through a wash and dry.  If you followed the wash instructions provided I don't see how this would happen, more than likely instructions weren't followed.  I know i'm guilty of \"lazy laundry day\" where everything gets cold water and high heat in the dryer just to get it done fast.  I'm happy I did it right for this sheet..

I use it mostly for hard/soft boiled eggs and rice.. My old rice cooker could make rice and also soft or hard boiled eggs, but it was MUCH slower. Rice took 45 minutes and hard boiled eggs, 25 minutes.. The first thing I tried with the Instant Pot was 2 hard boiled eggs. They were ready in under 10 minutes total, from loading it with 1 cup of room temperature water to completely done. Amazing! Time is money and what I used to have to wait about 25 minutes for I can now do in under 10 minutes!. Rice took about 12 minutes for 2 cups.! I can literally have friends over and if we decide to have some rice with our dinner, I can make it and have it completely ready while they are practically still just pouring drinks. Amazing!. I also really like that the inner pot is stainless steel and not some non stick coating like my prior rice cooker was. I think it's healthier not to have coatings that could potentially flake off or leach in to your food.. I'm a single guy and bought the 6 quart version which seems just about the right size.. I'm excited to try cooking more dishes in my Instant Pot and it was money well-spent!. UPDATE: I even tried making pasta and it turned out great and in under 7 minutes total. I just added enough pasta for a single serving, some pasta sauce out of a jar, 1 cup of water. I used the Manual setting for 3 minutes. After it was done, I quick released the steam and presto, perfect pasta! Amazing."},

This is the second one I have and is well on its way to be my favorite.  Cooking for two, I seldom need the higher capacity of the larger models and haven't pressed to see how small a quantity I could cook without issues.  Tonight was my personal mix or whole grain rices with a 1 cup rice quantity.  It came out well.  I will try half the quantity next time to better match the needed quantity.. I cook at sea level and also at 6000 feet in the mountains.  The Instant Pot does pressure cooking by temperature, so I can use the same recipe at either altitude.  This new Mini will relieve me from carrying my one pot from one altitude to another.. From my standpoint, this is pressure cooking as it should have been.  No fussing with the burner flame and when there is steam enough ... just pick a cooking time and match it with the right liquid level for reproducible results.

I even got rid of my stovetop pressure cooker, because I wasn't using it anymore. This one does the job perfectly well, with no noise, and no mess. I use the pressure cook function to make flan, meat, and beans. The slow cooker is fantastic for busy working families especially. No one feels like cooking when we get home from work, so I prep meals the night before, toss the in the Instapot in the morning before going to work, and leave it slow cooking throughout the day. The timer is great, because I can customize cooking times exactly how I want them. The saute feature is a huge bonus. A lot of slow cooker recipes require that you brown the meat first. It really saves the mess and hassle of browning it on the stove, and then transferring it over to the slow cooker. I simply use the saute feature to brown whatever I need, then turn it off, switch to slow cook mode, cover, and walk away. It's the best feeling to get home from work in the evening and have a home cooked meal ready to go!"},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I've had nothing but success with this.", "review_body": "I first made teriyaki chicken with vegetables and it was easy and delicious. The chicken was very tender. The next day I made beef enchiladas using stew beef chunks. After cooking, the saut\u00e9 feature reduced the liquid much faster than my gas stove ever did. The enchiladas were amazingly good with a strong beef flavor combined with the enchilada sauce flavor. I've struggled with tough meat before, but the 20 minutes with the 3lbs of chicken and the 30 minutes with the 2.5lbs of stew beef resulted in perfectly tender meat. Cooking bone broth for 3 hours resulted in a very gelatinous broth (slow cooker takes many more hours).. The heating element and thick bottomed inner pan design provides perfectly even heat. The controls are very easy to use, but I suggest reading the first few pages of the manual to get a good idea of all the features. The way that it heats up to the selected pressure, keeps it there with very little steam escaping, and shuts off after the programmed time, produces great results every time. You can barely smell what it is cooking - I don't smell the food in the house the next day as a slow cooker can do. And I believe the claimed energy savings since it doesn't radiate much heat.. It is hard to cook great meals after coming home from work, but this has made it much easier and less error prone. And I love to hear my kids ask for seconds.

I have been so excited to try the instant pot, and from the 1.5 things made in it before it broke twice it was fantastic.  The pressure sensor was faulty so by mistake I contacted Instant pot's customer  service.  After emailing and having a turn around time of 24 hours between responses, and multiple questions plus sending multiple pictures of how it was malfunctioning  (including pictures of stickers with serial numbers cut in half, to prove i cut it in half) they agreed to send out another base.... 7 to 10 business days shipping (note i recieved this through Amazon prime 2 day shipping)  after recieving the new base a week and a half later I set it up excited to try again.... BUT the lid was still giving me issues(having to hold the pressure valve with hot pad to release pressure) again I went back to customer service who again requested pictures of the issue, asking what I was cooking, and the amount of water and if i pushed it this way.  I reminded them of the pictures.  They expressed how apologetic they were (really I felt more as though I was questioned over their faulty product more than helped) and now again have to wait another 5 to 10 business days to get a replacement piece for the faulty lid.  They say they are concerned about it being faulty but have not asked once to have it sent back to them to review.. AGAIN I was so excited about this product and all the possibilities it had to offer but instant pot's customer service is extremely difficult to work with and here I am April 4th, and opened a problem with them middle of march and now will be waiting an additional 1.5 weeks to have a working appliance.. NOTE TO SELF: never go through instant pot's customer service and work only with amazon who would have made this a quick and easy switch.  Shame on me going through the actual company.. Once I am sent and used the actual non faulty product I am hoping to get the use and love everyone has for it.  Instant pot's customer service has truly left a pour taste in my mouth.  (The people I have talked to have been pleasant for the most part, other than the repetitive questioning of their own product, it is the process (or due diligence as was written to me via email) that is horrendous.)"},

DO: Find the Facebook IP group, download the IP recipe app, and if you want to really take it further find the freezer meal IP boot camps and get 30 meals prepared and frozen so all you have to do is pop them into the IP and in about 30-45 you have a hot, delicious dinner. I love having the freezer meals not only for my family, I still cook in between when I feel like it, but when others need a meal I have something ready to go.. You'll find you'll want more than one, and, really I'm not just justifying myself, when you have a meal cooking but need a side of vegetables or something like or rice or pasta you'll want to have another one.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Fast. Easy.  Not scary.", "review_body": "I was scared to ever try pressure cooking with the old-fashioned stove top type and was even pretty afraid of trying it the new electric style.  Turns out the new style is awesome!  Everything I've made in it so far was great and it was super easy to use and not at all risky or spooky.  It is pretty fast.  I do wish more recipes you see for it (especially like on the internet) did a better job of telling you the whole truth about how long they really take.  The pot takes a while to get up to full pressure (and some things need time to release the pressure slowly when the food is done), so you have to add that in to your cook time.  Too many recipes will say things like \"3 minute steel cut oats\".  But the truth is that you have to add in another 10 or 15 minutes for the pot to get up to pressure, then you have the 3 minutes of pressurized cooking, then you add in another 10 or 15 minutes for the pressure to release. Yeah, you hear about beans from dry to on the table in 20 minutes, but it's really beans start to finish in closer to 45 minutes to an hour. While it's still DRAMATICALLY faster and easier than the stovetop methods, it's not as lightning quick from fridge or pantry to table as many recipes make it sound.. I used it last night to make chicken broth from the carcass of a baked whole chicken.  Wow was it fast!  Instead of the really really slow process that it usually is to cook broth on the stove (like it's not crazy to have it cooking basically all day), it was done (and really really done really richly) in about 2 hours total, from dropping the chicken into the pot and plugging it in to putting finished broth in the fridge.  And it didn't require the wasted energy of having a stove burning all day or the having to keep a bit of an eye on a running stove all day.. I especially loved it for making potato soup, too.  It made soup from scratch fast enough to make it an easy convenient lunch meal.  No more canned soup for my house.  Fresh home made is quick and easy and delicious in the pressure cooker."},

We ordered it in mid-December (shipped & received very quickly, as usual) while on vacation in California.  When we returned home we unpacked it and put it to the test. So far everything we've tried has been excellent. We are partial to brown rice and this pressure cooker has delivered a perfect batch twice, so far. 22 minutes at pressure, short cool down and voila! Perfectly done. Boneless chicken thighs in a savory sauce in 15 minutes plus about 10 minutes cool down. Fork tender. Yummy. Clean up is easy and the stainless steel pot remains in spotless new condition. That was an important factor in buying this highly praised cooker. We did not want a non-stick coating on the cook surface and it definitely does not need it, at least in our experience to date.. If you are considering an electric pressure cooker this one deserves a hard look. We love it.. One last note..

But it does work well and it is very efficient for people who have not much time.  It turned out to be that you can make various cooked meal with left over vegetables with frozen chicken or beef that you can put them in the pot to cook together within short time period.  With less oil and less amount of sodium, you can make various dishes easily.  I wanted to choose 3Qt instead of 6 Qt to make it smaller, which is also the best choice.

It does tend to read about a half-pound heavier than a couple of other scales I have compared it to, but it is hard to say whether this one is high or the others are low.. It's a good looking scale with large, easy-to-read numbers, but there are no bells and whistles here.  If you want body composition, water weight, or even measurements down to a tenth of a pound, look elsewhere. Although the readout suggests that it will weigh in increments of .1 pound, it only reports in increments of .2 (100.2, 100.4, etc.).  For the price, it's great.

I'm comparing directly to Bounty brand bought at Costco, which are just fine. These Plenty Ultra Premium genuinely feel nicer, and work better. I was surprised the quality jump was so noticeable. The Plenty Ultra paper towels are thick but soft. You could use them as a facial tissue and not feel like they were harsh or scratchy, yet I also have used them to scrub out pans and they held up, scrubbed well, and didn't shred.. The rolls are not the oversized paper towel rolls we've gotten used to. They are standard sized rolls, so will fit in any paper towel holder you have. I haven't calculated the cost per quantity compared to those I got at Costco, but I certainly do like having this large packaged delivered to my door."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Above average paper towels.", "review_body": "The Plenty Ultra Premium Paper Towels are above average paper towels.. I did the wet strength test with a 16 oz cup of water. The wet Plenty paper towel was able to lift and hold the vessel. I did some scrubbing with  a wet towel and it held up acceptably well. I was able to tear the wet paper towel with moderate force, so it won't replace a cloth towel,. The surface is soft. This is good for cleaning your face, but not so good if you need some abrasive force to clean a dirty counter top.. The case shipped by Amazon contains 24 rolls. For me, this will last months. I like having a big supply, but if you have limited storage space, this could be a problem. I suppose you can order the case and then give a six pack to your mother, your aunt, and your cousin."},

I was leary of buying an off brand online without knowing how thick they are, because we all know those cheaper brands can be like tissue paper, and fall apart as soon as they get wet.

I love how thick Bounty paper towels and these are almost as good as the Bounty brand.  They are thick and they do clean up spills well.  I did not compare the pricing of these towels compared to the Bounty select a size but I am guessing that they will be considerably less since Bounty is one of the most expensive paper towel brands.  If these paper towels continue to perform as well as the first roll I have been using then I might be buying these from now on instead of the Bounty paper towels that I have been buying for years."},

They compare quiet favorably with the \"house\" brand in one of the major shopping clubs.  Depending on the price (they aren't currently available on Amazon for retain purchase, so I don't know what that would be), we'd certainly consider replacing what we've been using with these.  I just wish they came with the half-sheet option, rather than always having to use a full sheet or do a rough tear from the roll to get a small er piece.  Still, above average, and compares nicely with \"store\" brands as well as national brands."},

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Convenient and easy to clean and use, but needed accessories are a bit expensive.", "review_body": "I bought this for my husband, as he does 95% of the cooking for the both of us and he likes kitchen gadgets.  He has an old-time huge steel stove-top pressure cooker that he uses on occasion, but for some reason it scares the crap out of me so I figured I would not be afraid to use the Instant Pot.  I bought the mini since it is just us.  My first try with it was a pot roast.  I bought a 2.5 lb roast, which left just enough room for the vegetables.  I followed the cooking timer table in the recipe book that came with the Instant Pot.  It said 15 minutes per lb for a roast, so I set the timer for 45 minutes just to give it a tad more time.  It actually took close to an hour and 15 minutes before it was ready, as I checked it and turned it back on, but still better than roasting it all day in the oven and heating up the house.  I then threw the vegetables in and in 10 minutes we had a great dinner!  I am looking forward to trying some different recipes and maybe coaxing my husband to use it.. Pros:. *Even though I bought the mini, it was larger than I thought it would be; just enough for dinner for 2 and leftovers the next day.. *Super easy to clean; just throw the stainless steel pan in the dishwasher and easily wipe down the rest with a damp cloth.. *Quiet!  Once you plug it in and turn it on, you can't even hear it.. Cons:. *Extra parts that are needed are super expensive, and some not available at all for the mini.  They could have thrown in a little steamer basket instead of a bunch of goofy plastic accessories that I won't even use.. *The cord is a little short, at only 36 inches.. *The steam release valve seems flimsy, but it does the job.  Just BE VERY CAREFUL when releasing the steam and don't put your hand or face anywhere near the top.  Just kind of stand back and flick it from the side."},

Lots of recipes on Pinterest and I'm told there is a whole following on Facebook.It does rice and it turned out pretty good.I've also done chicken breasts, boneless pork loin chops and salisbury steak meatballs. So far so good. I saw a couple of reviews of people saying the silicon ring in the lid started to smell like something they cooked. I didn't give the comment much credence but sure enough on the second dish I made I sues some strong spice and the next time I used the Instant Pot I could definitely smell it..and yes I clean it thoroughly every time I sue it.

I had the more basic version of this pot and it performed well.  Gave to my sister in law and I wanted this one because of the increased options.  First issue was the lid did not lock and stay put.  Very different than my other Instant Pot which felt very secure when moved to the close position.  This pot you could move with one finger out of the close to open position.  This was scary because in pressure cooking that's a safety concern.. However, first use, I pressed on.  Loaded in my ingredients for soup/broth setting.  Hit the button and heard the 3 beeps.  Then it lost power after about two minutes.  I unplugged it, plugged in back in, nothing.  Waited a short while plugged it back in, got the power display.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I'm an Instant IP Fan!", "review_body": "Absolutely love my instant pot...both of them.  I bought the 8 quart pot first.  I loved it so much after using it once (on the Kahlua pork recipe in the included recipe book) that I bought the 6qt a week later so I can make a full meal  or a single pot meal with a dessert at one time quickly. Here are some pro's, cons, and tips I've discovered in the short, but fun time I've used my pots.  I'll start with the cons since there is only one.. Cons:. 1.  The stainless steel inner pot has has a few small \"light spots\".  No effect on cooking though.. Pros:. 1.  No spill-overs. The locking lid keeps juices and liquid inside the pot.. 2. Space saving.  Easily fits on my counter tops. 3. Time saving.  Meals cook in less than half the time than conventional methods.. 4. Safe Cooking.  The timer, included safety features (e.g. Auto shut off , lid lock etc.). 5.  Lots of cooking options: steam, pressure cooking, saut\u00e9e/brown, rice, etc.  All work as phenomenally.  (I've used manual mostly, but I've tested several of the automatic functions.. 6.  Included product manual and recipe book guide users through the steps of using the pot.. 7.  Included rack and measuring cup are a great addition.  The rack makes lifting items out of the inner pot a breeze.. 8.  Option of using either high or low pressure allows for cooking an even wider variety of foods (some delicate foods work better with low pressure). Tips:. 1.  Recommend purchasing glass lid, additional sealing rings (at least one for savory and one for sweet dishes), steamer trays and 6 or 7 inch aluminum, casserole, springform or other oven safe pans for cooking in dishes that can be store in the cooking container.  These are also great for making desserts. The extra rings com in handy for keeping sweet flavors sweet and savory flavors savory in the pot.  The rings take on the smell of the foods you cook.  Washing and air drying after each use helps with this.  The glass lid is great for saut\u00e9ing and slow cooking because it allows you to visually monitor the saut\u00e9es or slow cooking.. 2.  For Cleaning I recommend rubbing the stainless steel inner pot with a half of lemon (with rind) after washing it in warm soapy water (though it is dishwasher safe).  Like many stainless steel pots, sometimes food leaves stains or film on the surface (e.g. Pasta film) even after washing.  Rubbing with a lemon half, rinsing and re-washing helps tremendously.  Helps with stainless steel steamer trays too.. 3.  If using the 8 quart on standard countertops with cabinets overhead, I've found that draping a towel across the cabinet door helps absorb steam from quick release.  I use a towel when using my 6 quart as well.. 4.  I recommend purchasing an instant pot specific cookbook.  The included book is good, but, it has mostly single item dishes.  I've noted that some books focus on \"one-pot\" meals which is a custom fit for the instant pot.. I definitely recommend the instant pot.  In fact I'm thinking of gifting a couple to friends."},

I called company for assist and able to get representative quickly however, it did take them a while to figure out the entire machine needed to be reset.  They guided me step by step to reset it, which was easy but the entire ordeal was successful.  TIP: Try out all new electronic items before actually depending on them.. I also found that their instructions for \"fall off the bone\"  meat (roast, pork chops..)  on \"Meat/Stew\" setting cooks it for 45 minutes and the meat is done however, NOT close to \"southern peoples, fall of the bone\" expectations.  Therefore, I press the \"Meat/Stew\" button for the 45 min cooking as directed, then when alarm goes off I (do NOT open the lid) just push the \"Meat/Stew\" button again and let it cook  another 45 min.  I'm sure I could use the \"manual\" method to set it for 120 minutes however, apparently I'm too lazy to figure out how to use the manual option."},

It speeds up the time for cooking beans, rice, soups, and other dry grains, plus it seals in flavors and makes the final product have a more savory and complex flavor.. Mostly, I use it for soups and beans. I cook big pots of refried beans to eat as a nutritious and inexpensive staple throughout the week.. I have lost 20 lbs and saved hundreds of dollars on food in the 6 months since I purchased the Instant Pot.. My sister baked a cake in it. The cake was moist and delicious.. Additionally, I have made omelettes, steel cut oatmeal, rice pudding, and the best mashed potatoes ever.. The only con is that it comes with very limited recipes and you need a separate book or to join an online group for recipes."},

White rice was done after 12 minutes!. I made a pork loin rost with potatoes and turned out amazing!!!!. It's really worth having this pressure cooker!!!!. I would definitely buy it again"},

For all yogurt and/or natto (Japanese fermented beans) makers out there, get this pressure cooker if you're looking for one!. Few months ago, I was introduced to food called natto by my Japanese friend, and I fell in love.  I eat natto every morning with bowl of rice now.  Who would have thought! LOL.  Despite the stinky smell, it tastes great!  How should I describe it, hmmm... it's like stinky cheese, it smells so bad but tastes soooo good!  Is it also weird that I taste hint of coffee bean in the natto??  Well, it does for me, and I love it!. Anyways, I eat so much natto now, I started making it after researching and getting recipe on the internet.  You need pressure cooker and a warmer (like yogurt maker) to make natto, and this instant pot has both features.  I love it!!. So all you natto lovers out there, try making natto at home with organic, non-gmo soybeans, and get this instant pot.  Also, talk about all the health benefits of natto!  Go google it, you'll be surprised how good it does to your body.. I wanted this for so long!  But I was concerned if I would use it often enough to make my moneys worth.  So I waited like a year debating weather I should or shouldn't buy it.  I didn't want to buy it mostly because I had slow cooker at home sitting in cablinet only to come out once or twice a year during cold seasons, and thought this pressure cooker will do the same.  WRONG!!!! Wow.. I so regret waiting so long to buy this!  I use it at least once a week!  I'm having so much fun cooking with this pressure cooker.  If you are like me and wondering, DON'T.  Just buy it, and you'll know what to do with it almost every week if not everyday."},

As anyone who bargain shops for whatever is on sale will tell you, though, not all paper towels are made alike. Some are fluffy and soft, some coarse and rough, some more absorbent than others, etc.. These fall on the softer side of things. They're fairly gentle on the hands, and even soft enough to wipe your face with (which is one of the product's selling points). Good absorbency, too. I cut tons of fresh fruits and veggies, so my cutting board is always covered in slop. These handled the mess just fine, with no tearing, leaking, or coming apart. They break down nicely in my compost as well.. If I had a criticism, it would be the cut of the individual towels. These are cut into your standard large paper towels, roughly 11 by 11 inches. However, I've really come to appreciate paper towels that are cut to half that width. In other words, two smaller towels rather than one larger towel. This allows you to save paper when you're only using them to clean up a very small mess or using them in place of napkins. With this brand, many times I used twice the towel I would have had they been perforated to a smaller size.. A minor gripe, perhaps, but those smaller sizes have become a big selling point to me. Do that and this gets five stars.. That minor personal issue aside, good brand that gets the job done with no fuss and no mess."},

Size: Is perfect, not to too big so that they fit in my kitchen dispenser, and not too little so I feel like I\u2019m being ripped off.. Absorbent: They are on the thick side, so they pick up a lot.. Softness: Not very soft. I wouldn\u2019t use these for your nose or sensitive skin, but they are softer than the leading brand.. Strength: While they are slightly softer than the leading brand, they are rough and strong enough to still add some scratching power when cleaning cabinets and such..

After  never having  trouble with  ripping  with thsee kitchen  bags. We started having  the drawstring top tear off every  bad we tried to  lift  out of  two 13 gallon  cans we use. On for kitchen  trash and one for non-newsprint  ads that aren't recyclable.. When got to looking  at the bags to see why this continued to  happen.  I found  what looked to be a perforated line all around the bag. Both rolls had this line . What  the defect was from . I  don't  have  any idea but, I  cannot  see  a reason why  you  could  possibly  want  your drawstring to tear off and spill it's  contents.  We are fished with these bags now and couldn't  recomend these either.. Original  review. My grandmother has preferred to use Glad brand  trash bags for many  years.  These Glad kitchen  trash bags  were one of  the  first items  on our S&S list.. They are a pretty  good  quality  trash bag and, we haven't had any  problems  with  ripping.. 1 con that we have been noticing  is that these bags have gone from an unscented bag to one that had a light scent . Up until  this July's ( 7/17)  shipment  where it  now  has a very strong scent.  Grandma  doesn't  mind it much. So they are still okay with her.. Personally  as a migraine  headache  suffer  I  don't  care for many  scented products  because they often trigger a headache.  This was my experience with thsee stronger  scented bags unfortunately.. There is no mention of a  scent on the product  box . Leaving me to  wonder if  this is  from the  way Amazon  stores these bags in their warehouse;  or if it's  a manufacturing issue  during the production of the product ? Leaving  us with the  opinion  that  they are  a good product  for those who  don't  mind a strong  mystery  scent to them"},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "long lasting", "review_body": "I used to buy other competitors\u2019 paper towel brands, and most brands worked for me well until I found and tried Brawny\u2019s. It seems to me that Brawny lasts longer than others. The surface is slightly rougher, but that actually works better for tougher pickups and wiping rougher areas. The sheets feel thicker and that\u2019s what makes this brand lasts longer. My main usage of this product is to clean the skillet with left over oil on and cleaning toilets and stuff in the bathroom. I noticed the absorbing power is also great when wiping off spills. For some lighter cleaning and pickup duty, I usually rinse off the used Brawny sheets under running water and reuse couple more times. I am impressed by how long it can last and hold the fibers to stay in shape over multiple usage. It\u2019s also wasteful if I just toss the sheets away after one time use.. The current price with the coupon($4) is about $20 after S&S 15% off (16XL roll pack). That\u2019s only $5 for 4 rolls and I think that\u2019s a great deal for the quality paper towels. But I see the real saving in the product itself. Its long lasting quality is what\u2019s saving me money over time because I could buy less frequently.. Overall, this is a great quality and value paper towel that lasts longer than any other brands I\u2019ve tried. I would probably stick to this for a while until I find something way better in both quality and the price."},

I fought him on it for as long as I could, thinking that the last thing I needed was another appliance. This time, I have to admit that I was wrong. This machine has come to rescue quite a few times and I absolutely love it! The first time I cooked a beef roast in the Instant Pot, I was going out with some friends and wanted to make sure my husband and kids had food. Since I was rushing, I seasoned my roast with salt and pepper (nothing else), chopped a whole onion and put in a cup of beef broth. When I came back home, the first thing my son (who is a very picky eater) said was, \"Dinner was really good!\" This was a shock because everything he eats is \"okay.\" My husband asked what I had done differently with the seasoning because the roast tasted like it had cooked for hours and it was amazing! When I told him how I prepared it, he said that it was impossible because it was more flavorful than any other that I've cooked. So, I no longer feel the need to season my beef roasts with a million different seasonings! If it's not broken, I'm not trying to fix it!. I know I just raved about a beef roast, but I have cooked chicken, pork, baked potatoes, and soups in my Instant Pot and everything turns out perfect so I have recommended these to all of my friends--even those who think they don't need another kitchen appliance."},

I\u2019ve had this for about 4 months. I use it at least 3x a week. It\u2019s been such a great addition to my kitchen. I got rid of my slow cooker and rice cooker. I even bought an duo80 as a secondary for when I need a larger capacity or cooking two things at once.. But the 6 quart is what I use most often. We are a family of 4 (2 kids under 10) and so far I have felt the 6 quart has been perfect for us. It also comes to pressure a bit faster than the 8 quart.. I recommend joining some recipe groups on social media. So many ideas.. What I like most about this product:. 1) one pot cooking. Most recipes everything is cooked in one pot. From saut\u00e9ing to browning, then pressure cooking. You don\u2019t even have to pressure cook if you don\u2019t want to.. 2) pretty much set it and forget it! Once you start it you can walk away and do stuff. And it\u2019s a much shorter time than a slow cooker. So I don\u2019t have to load it up in the morning before work.. 3) so many recipes are out there! So many! I\u2019ve tried Indian Butter Chicken, spaghetti and meat sauce (with noodles), rice is so quick!, honey garlic chicken, chicken adobo, chicken pho ga, chicken soup, ribs, even cheesecake and banana bread.. 4) Cooking from frozen! When I\u2019m in a pinch and not sure what to make I can always take out some frozen chicken to make something. In fact I keep a whole, pre-seasoned chicken in my freezer all the time (3-4 lb). I\u2019ll pull that out. It takes about an hour and a half because I like to broil it after for 5\u201310 minutes.. Seems like a long time but it\u2019s from frozen! Frozen!. 5) one pot cooking = One pot to cleaning"},

I followed the recipes exactly as written. I called instapot to see if there was anything that could be done. After being on hold for over an hour I was given a ticket number because there was nothing they could do and told someone would contact me in 2 business days. After 7 business days and no contact I sent the item back to amazon after reading the reviews that instapot customer service was terrible. Instead of a refund I asked for a replacement. Big mistake.

I LOVE this pot!. early christmas gift and already cooked a rack of ribs in 30 minutes that fell off the bone, and tried a beef strogganoff  tonight that was delish!. was concerned noodles might not cook well, but they were perfect.I didnt need a pan to cook the meat, and a pan for the pasta, and a strainer for the noodles, NOPE!!!  all cooked in the same pot. pot has a saute button to brown  meats or saute veg.,  biggest con is having to figure out how much water for each type of  product your cooking and amount you are cooking and how much time.  just go online and type in instant pot recipes and you will get thousands to try. With time I'm sure it will become second nature.  haven't tried this yet, but you can cook a whole chicken that is frozen in about an hour!  thats amazing.  Can't even imagine how this could help working moms who come home and have dinner to cook. Saves time and money because instead of cooking the ribs in the oven several hours, it was done in 30 min., also will save extra money when I'm not heating up the house with the stove on, while the air conditioning is running.  It is also a crock pot, and has delay start function. Recommend checking out review questions as it answers a lot of normal questions, and check out some of the recipes on line to see how simple they can be.  Highly recommend"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "It really is.", "review_body": "So, this handy gadget is most likely going to completely displace slow cookers in my kitchen. It really is (so far), as great as it's made out to be. My first dish in the Instant Pot was pasta sauce. The saute function worked beautifully for browning the meat, and the sauce was done in a grand total of two hours (browning, heating, cooking, depressurizing), vs the 6 to 8 hours it would have taken on the stove. The one downside to cooking the sauce in this vs on the stove top is that the sauce didn't reduce and thicken any, like it does on the stove, which is easily countered by making the base thicker to begin with. I'll be making cheesecake with it at some point (how could I not?), as well as yogurt. And pot roast, and bbq pulled pork, and soups and stews... There will be a bit of a learning curve with seasonings, you can't just sample and adjust in the middle of cooking with this unit.. The lid can be a little tricky to clean, there are a lot of little spots stuff can get into and you can't just drop it into a sink full of water. The insert you cook in is heavy stainless steel, with what appears to be an aluminum core bottom. I kind of wish there was some way to disable the chime that sounds when you open and close the lid, it scares my dog. The cookbook has some great looking recipes in it, but... Half of the cookbook is written in Kanji, and from the photos it looks like mostly different recipes than the English section.. I bought extra silicone seal rings with the unit, based on reviewer's recommendations. One ring will be for savory cooking, the other for sweets. I can see just a touch of discoloration of the seal ring from just the one use (no real surprise, tomato stains everything) but can't detect any absorbed smells yet."},

These are the best paper towels I have ever used without question.. Sure you are thinking that all paper towels are the same. Nope...couldn't be further from the truth. We use paper towels a lot in our house. They are busy wiping our fingers during cooking, our napkins while eating, used to scrub a spill or to clean a mirror.. My favorite paper towel before I used these was Viva. They are expensive, smell and leave lint on surfaces. But they are also super soft and durable--just like cloths. Most often the smell issue bothered me the most. Go to wipe your mouth and it hits you--this is not a pleasant scent.. So thes Brawny paper towels manage to be soft but firm (useful for scrubbing). Have no smell, come off the roll normally (so you don't get stuck with more \"sheets\" than you wanted) and manage to soak up spills well. They even do a decent job leaving less lint on mirrors..

I'm a big fan of pick-a-size paper towels. Many times when I need a paper towel, I really only need a piece of paper towel instead of an entire large sheet. With these towels, the perforations are closer together because each perforated sheet is shorter when compared to  \"normal\" full sheet sized paper towels. So I don't waste paper towels because I can rip off a smaller section at a time.. These are quite absorbent and definitely stronger than the el-cheapo bargain basement brands...Sparkle, I'm looking at you..

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "There\u2019s a Reason Brawny is a Paper Towel Icon \u2026", "review_body": "Paper towels, toilet paper and tissues are pretty much the same when it comes to quality.  You can go cheap, but there are consequences.  Brawny is a higher-end paper towel, but I feel its quality is worth the extra cost if you can avoid unnecessary waste.  The BRAWNY PICK-A-SIZE PAPER TOWEL offers a better paper towel and reduces unnecessary waste.. The quality of the Brawny towels are noticeable to the touch.  Bargain brands have a flimsy feel and a noticeably dimpled texture.  These single-ply Brawny towels are noticeably thicker with a smoother, softer texture.  They absorb more and are far more durable when wet.  I often use paper towels as a follow-up to Clorox wipes in the kitchen and bathrooms (the wipes don\u2019t collect dust very well and leave wet streaks of chemicals).  Less expensive paper towels get soaked quicker and tear apart \u2026 I use half the number of Brawny towel segments to complete this task.  They Brawny towels also fare much better in eliminating streaks when cleaning windows and mirrors.. This particular size (140 sheets) is double the size of the standard Brawny roll.  The pick-a-size option is pretty standard these days, but it matters more when you\u2019re paying more for quality \u2026 less waste.  As a person with dealing with allergies all my life, paper towels have been my go-to tissues for decades.  The ability to use half-sheets of absorbent towels that won\u2019t tear apart or tear-up my nose day-after-day really matters to me.  I find it hard to argue the cost/benefit of these premium paper towels."},

It soaked through the sheets and to the mattress protector, which kept it off the mattress. So it did exactly what I wanted it to.. There are some things to note about this:. It doesn't seal the entire mattress, it's basically a fitted sheet where the portion over the top of the mattress has a plastic-like barrier under a second fabric layer. Because of this, there's no protection on the sides of the mattress. If you're getting this to protect a mattress from a child's urine, it may not work if the kid floors near the edge, since it could run down the side of the bed and soak through the side.. If you're like me and have an a-hole cat that turns to your mattress every time it's feeling a little upset, then this mattress protector works great.. It is not 100% silent, but it is very quiet. It's not like those zipped thick plastic abominations from childhood, it's a very thin plastic barrier and makes minimal noise -- it's quiet enough that someone probably wouldn't even realize it's not the sheets. Since it's waterproof, that does mean it is going to block airflow up and down, so you'll get hot and sweaty if your room is already warm. But that hasn't been a problem for me."},

I made three dishes in it, details below. TLDR at bottom.. The same day that it arrived, I went grocery shopping and saw a 13# turkey on sale for $0.50/lb. I had to grab one and decided to test my new Instant Pot. I have never cooked my own turkey before but figured for $7, I was willing to try. Since the turkey was too big for the 8qt Instant Pot (according to the manual you want food to fit below a certain line), I cut off the poor bird's legs and stuffed it in the pot along with some water mixed with spices and powdered stock. The Instant Pot took maybe 40 minutes to pressurize and then cooked for my manual request of 60 minutes on high pressure. I checked the internal temp on the bird before removing and it was good to go. Folks, the meat was already falling off the bones, it was so tender. I decided to take the whole pot and dump it into a strainer resting over a larger bowl (to catch all the juices) and transferred the turkey to a pan to rest.. Next, I took some fingerling potatoes cut in halves along with about a cup of the saved juices and roughly followed the small roast potatoes recipe from the recipe book that was included. This also used to pressure cooker function, which I noticed took less time to pressurize this time (probably because it wasn't so stuffed). These potatoes came out perfectly cooked (and delicious) in about 30 minutes from start to finish, including prep.. Last, I decide to use the Saute function to make some gravy. The pot heats pretty quickly for this function, even if you haven't already been cooking. I used the remaining juices from the turkey, added flour,and whisked on high until incorporated, then turned back down to low to simmer. Bam - delicious gravy.. TLDR: I made a delicious Thanksgiving dinner in under 3 hours from start to finish on my first ever attempt AND with an unfamiliar appliance. I'm sold and can't wait to use it again."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Awesomeness!", "review_body": "This is what I ordered but got an older version- the 6 in 1.. That said, after trying one out for myself,  I bought one for each of my daughters and daughter's in laws.. Highly impressed with the ease of use and how quickly it heats up and begins coming on its own.. A flavorful low temp cooked and steamed beef stew in under 3 hours.. The stainless removable insert wiped clean with a paper towel,  even after flooring and braising the meat first.  Amazing!  The bottom of the cooking pot insert is made of a very thick stainless steel,  so gives a uniform and consistent  heating across the bottom.. I made cheesy ham and potato soup in 10 minutes -  minus the chopping time of the potatoes and ham of course. Tasted like it had simmered all day. Rich flavor were infused throughout.. So much easier and more versatile than a stove top pressure cooker that stays cool to the touch on the outside. At is a 3 temp adjustable slow cooker -  with or without steam; a pressure cooker, searing pot, rice cooker; vegetable and crab steamer;  yogurt maker; milk pasteurizer; and I read that the 7 in 1 could also be used as a canner since it's psi is higher than the 6 in 1. . Which is why I had ordered that one in particular.. In my 1st week,  I cooked pork ribs (from frozen state)  to the point of falling off the bone in less than 25 minutes on steam. I added sauce right at the end and let it finish with the steam vent opened.  Yummy!. Last night I cooked rice in 10 minutes start to finish, set it aside in a lidded casserole while I quickly seared 4 chicken breasts,  then put lid on and steamed them on medium. In 10 minutes they were fork tender.  I then put the chicken on top of the rice in the casserole dish,  covered the chicken  with homemade cherry bbq sauce and broiled it for 5 minutes . Paired with a toss salad, it was the perfect,  delicious,  healthy dinner!. The daughters and in-laws love theirs as well, making chicken stock in 10 minutes,  bbq pulled pork for sandwiches, split pea and ham soup from scratch in record time. . No more soaking dried beans overnight. .. This has become a permanent piece on the kitchen counter!"},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Like it a lot, but keep the manual handy", "review_body": "I really like this device.  It makes quite a few things just perfectly.  It has very high quality construction.  The cord has the same connectors as a standard computer cord, but is really heavy duty.  It has numerous safety features, like redundant pressure and temperature sensors, and a elegantly simple pressure activated interlock to prevent removing the lid when there there is pressure inside.  But the controls are difficult to use.  That kept it from getting 5 stars.. As to the controls, there is this very confusing \"adjust\" button.  It does different things for each of the about 7 basic selections.  For soups, saute, and slow cook it controls the temperature.  For porridge you use it to tell the pot that it is multi-grain porridge, rather than rice.  For poultry it changes the cooking time.  (Redundant with the +and - buttons.)  For rice it has no effect.  For multigrain, you can choose between 3 choices:40 minutes, 20 minutes and 45 minutes of warm soaking followed by 60 minutes of pressure.  For steam and manual, the instruction manual makes no mention of this button. For yogurt you can choose an option to first bring the milk to a boil.  But for all of this, you only see \"less\", \"normal\", or \"more\" on the panel.  You have to have the manual at hand to know what \"less\", \"normal\", and \"more\" mean in the selected mode.. There is a delay function that allows you to delay the start for some amount of time.  (The button is labeled \"timer\".) When you naively use it, it seems that you can only set the delay to a multiple of an hour.  But, if you read the manual, you will discover that after you have set the hours, you can push \"timer\" again, and then the + and - buttons will control the minutes.. After most of the functions have run to completion, the unit is in a keep-warm state that does what you would expect.  But an extra piece of paper that comes in the box says that you can turn the keep-warm feature off by double-pressing the selection button (\"saute\", etc.)  when you first start.. And, finally, this additional piece of paper tells you that you can silence the beeps by pressing and holding the \"-\" button for 3 seconds.. So you had better keep the manual and the addendum handy in your kitchen.  You are going to need it."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Not so much Instant as Eventually....but worth it", "review_body": "In truth, it's really an \"Eventually Pot\". I made a pea/mushroom risotto with a strip of cut-up bacon for my maiden voyage.. Here's how the instant pot works: you saute the things which need to be sauted (mushrooms, onions,) in it in its saute mode. Then you turn it on. And then--for first timers--- you scour the internet and the books to see why it's not working. After about 15 minutes it starts to hiss and finally you see that the 6 minute cooking time is on.. After 6 minutes you have a choice: you can let it sit until the steam has died away and then open and eat (Natural Pressure Release) .  OR you can release the steam and it will hiss and jet up to the ceiling (this is where you are thankful you did not put it under your wooden counters). Then when it's finished its long hissy fit, it gives you the go ahead to open the pot and serve.. So---next time I will relax and not bite my nails while I'm waiting for it to do its thing.. Next time I will start earlier and let the steam dissipate all by itself--Natural release.. The Eventually Pot is a good idea for combining soups and cassaroles and things like that. Once you are used to its ways and realize that the 6. minute cooking time includes about 30-45 minutes of girding its loins and ungirding its loins, I see that it can do a good job.  If I had not been a Nervous Nellie I would have sat down with a book and relaxed.  That's what I'll do next time, which will probably be tomorrow.. The risotto? Very good; not mushy. Cooked perfectly. Perfect consistency.  The actual amount of time I took stirring the risotto was a tiny fraction of the time I have took making the risotto in the traditional way."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Works very well, and very quiet when pressurized", "review_body": "Works fantastically.. I have so far tried the pressure cooker and the slow cooker options with very good results.. I am a long term pressure cooker user and own 3 other standard pot style pressure cookers, this is my first electric. I must say it is so very quiet when it's pressurized. You can barely hear it unlike the old fashioned models.. My one and only complaint is the rubber seal is susceptible to absorbing smells. After the first use, after it was washed, we started to notice a strange smell in the kitchen and it took a few days before we figured out where the smell was coming from. I found the obnoxious aroma coming from the lid. I figured it was perhaps splatter in the vent area that perhaps didn't get cleaned well enough. After washing the lid again, I realized the smell was actually coming from the rubber seal.  I washed the seal in warm soapy water several times, even soaked it for a bit...it's better but still not great. I now store the seal in a gallon zip lock bag when not in use. It doesn't seem to be a problem during cooking, as I cannot smell that funk during that time. I even tried pressure cooking some water w/ lemon and herbs to try to get a better smell permeated into the rubber, but no luck. Hopefully it will go away in time."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "Complete Disappointment.", "review_body": "I bought this for the purpose of making yogurt.  I've been making yogurt for more than 30 years without a dedicated yogurt maker, but I thought, from the reviews, that this would be easier, since lately I've been having a bit of trouble keeping the incubation temperature consistent.  I also thought it might permit me to get rid of my large rice cooker, which I seldom use, and my old style non-electric pressure cooker, which I also rarely use.. I followed the yogurt instructions exactly.  As instructed, I pressed the yogurt setting, after placing the milk in the interior pan and closing the unit.  The yogurt did heat to the 180 F temperature.  After many many hours, it cooled to the 115 F temperature, and I added the culture, as per instructions.  After the appropriate number of hours, I opened it.  The milk was brown, and cooked onto the bottom of the pot.  I took its temperature, and it had heated to 143 degrees F, even though it had been at 115 when I added the culture.  Obviously, the overheating killed the culture.. If you want to make yogurt, I do not recommend this product. I cannot speak to its other uses, as I am returning it today."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Oh wait, did I mention how quiet this is?", "review_body": "OMGosh! Was curious about this product for a while, but didn't get one because we already had a stovetop pressure cooker. And a rice cooker. And a slow-cooker. Our daughter bought one and after she'd been using it I asked her. With 2 small children underfoot, she said it made a difference in a home cooked meal vs go-to-the-freezer-get-the-box. Since I bought one, have used it every week. Sometimes even twice a day! Can make \"boiled\" eggs very, very easily (use the rack, about 1-1/2 cups water & the rice setting - either pressure release). Had to make 2 batches of roasted butternut soup in under 2 hrs - nailed it! The ease and quietness of this is wonderful, too. One thing to remember, if new to pressure cooking, is to allow time for pressure building up and whatever pressure release time you're using (which is still shorter than making anything with a comparable result). The little recipe book that comes with it is good for getting you started, and has some decent recipes. Would also advise getting one of the well-reviewed cookbooks designed for an electric pressure cooker. I went ahead and bought the glass lid (for slow-cooking) because none of my other pot lids would fit. Of course :-) Is it necessary? Actually, not really, but is nice when it's serving time for a buffet. Is this multi-functional in a practical way? So far, I'd say yes. There are extra stainless steel (another plus)  inserts available, so changing from one method/dish to another can be done quickly and easily. Even without one (as in the case of the 2 batches of butternut soup), it's easy enough to empty, wash and get cooking again. Yes, the saute feature is great, too. If you want to know about the other features I haven't used yet, keep reading reviews because certainly, someone else has used them!"},

It gave a different reading every time I got on and off. Within 5 mintues, my weight varied up to 6 lbs. from the reading a moment prior. This is worse scale I ever owned. The company had a nice card in the box with a phone # to call if you are unhappy with product. When I took the time to call them  - I was given no special accomodations for calling. I didn't need to waste time calling when I simply ended up just returning it via amazon. All they said was they would notify their engineering dept. (How does this impact me? I just need a scale and thought maybe they'd offer a coupon of something if I called them per their request to notify them if you arent satisfied.

It hasn't given me the same weight twice, even 30 seconds apart. Unless I'm some modern medical marvel of fluctuating weight, the scale isn't accurate.. To account for natural shifts in body weight, I weigh myself at the same time every day. I count calories, I exercise regularly, the scale hasn't moved from its spot on the hardwood floor, and yet every time I weigh myself I get different results. Last week within a ten minute span, the scale registered my weight shifting from 168, 166.2, 167.4, and 166.8. A pair of eight pound weights measured in the same period weighed 16.2, 16.8, and 15.8. It seems like this scale has an error of +/- 2.0 lbs, which is just ridiculous.. I've tried following the recalibration instructions provided in the manual and by users on here multiple times, and it's still inaccurate. To ensure I wasn't being too hasty, I tried it again today. This morning at 8:08 AM, I weighed 163.8, 162.8, 163.4. Again, at 8:15 AM I weighed 164.8, 163.6, 164.4, and then finally 163.4.. Do I trust this scale? No."},

I'm fairly confident that I didn't lose 15 lbs over the course of an evening when I chose to have Chinese takeout for dinner.  I also let the scale reset and tried again and it showed me a 3 lbs weight difference from when I had stepped onto it moments before.. I'm not sure what might be the problem - I have it laid on the bathroom floor which is a hard (tile) surface.  I always step on and wait for the number to settle."},

I had strayed away from Brawny, but these may pull me back. Simply a great paper towel and when needed, one wants something that does the job.. The rolls are huge and being able to tear off half sheets is economical. And with these a half sheet is often all you need. For other purposes you can tear larger sheets as well. (Other brands also allow this, though.) I think the price is fair for what you get, a lot of tough, durable towels that do a great job.  Also, if (like me) you often use towels as a simple \"place mat\" then these are thick.strong, and work well at that, also. Work great for lining shelves as well. Lots of uses for these..

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Not Really a Slow Cooker", "review_body": "I ordered this specifically for use as a slow cooker, and I have to admit, I haven't used it for the other uses, which is why my review isn't as glowing as many of the others. My older slow cooker finally died, and I ordered one of the newer, digital models. What I found, and was confirmed by other reviewers, was that newer models, mandated by the FDA, cook at higher temperatures, so they are no longer really \"slow cookers.\". I ordered at least 3 different models and makes, and they all ruined my tried and true \"old school\" recipes that I used to make for years, you know the ones that you used to throw in before you left for work, and you came home and they were perfect. Not now. If I cooked my famous Tarragon Chicken in a new slow cooker, it was overcooked, dry, and stringy after only two or three hours. I was incredibly disappointed.. So, I heard wonderful things about the Instant Pot, and it was made in Canada, so I hoped they didn't have to go by FDA mandates. Imagine my disappointment when I found the same results with the slow cooker feature. My Tarragon Chicken couldn't go all day in this slow cooker either. The most it could go, even on the \"low\" setting, was about two hours max. Some of my \"foodie\" friends on a local food blog said to use the pressure cooker setting, but if I'd wanted a pressure cooker, that's what I'd buy. I realize I have that option, but I just wanted a real \"slow cooker\" like I had back in the day. I guess that's no longer and option. The FDA thinks we no longer no how to cook, even though we've been using slow cookers for decades, and have managed to live to tell the tale!. So, while the Instant Pot surely has many different functions that I haven't explored, and I probably will, what I bought it expressly for, what a big disappointment to me."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Love this electric pressure cooker", "review_body": "Love this for pressure cooking and regular cooking.  I have a stove top pressure cooker, which I like, but I love this one.  This is much more convenient to use since it has a timer on it and I don't have to sit and watch it while it is cooking.  I have replaced my rice cooker with this because the rice turns out even better in the pressure cooker.  I've noticed that when cooking rice, I do have to use a little less water than normal, otherwise, the rice is too soggy.  But, the rice turns out perfect once you get the hang of it.  I'm used to using a stove top pressure cooker and really don't use any special cookbooks to cook in this.  I like to be able to just throw a frozen piece of meat in the cooker and have a roast or something else cooked in a shorter time frame.  If the meat is frozen, just make sure you increase the time manually instead of using the pre-programmed setting or your food will not be done.  If you've been on the fence about getting a pressure cooker due to all of the horror stories of them exploding, if they did explode it is because they were not venting properly.  As long as you make sure the vent is venting correctly and the lid is on securely, you have nothing to worry about.  I purchased the stainless steel version and I also purchased a second stainless steel pot, because I use this a lot.  The stainless steel is very easy to clean and usually just soaking it in some hot, soapy water does the trick.  I use a non-scratching scrubber and some bar keeper's friend if there is some tough residue that just doesn't want to come out easily.  Haven't had any problems with it yet and have been using it for a while.  You might want to consider getting some of the Instant pot accessories like the glass lid, extra stainless steel pot, the silicone pot mini mitts, and an extra silicone gasket.  The silicone gasket tends to hold the odors of the food that you cooked, so I take mine out after using it and soak it to get rid of the odors and have the spare to cook in the pot again without having to wait."},

One bit of advice is that if you are new to them and nervous and have Facebook then join the group on there called Instant Pot Community! So many members who are so helpful. I joined then for about 4 days read every post , gathered great information and then felt ready to use my IP and have been going strong since.

Wow..I would now say it's a kitchen must have for me, like my Vitamix. I am clumsy and hate struggling with things but even I could manage this lid and getting it off and on (you can't get it off until the pressure is too a certain level though).. So far I have made gluten free chicken and dumplings, tortilla soup, stew, and just chicken thighs.. Like another reviewer mentioned, for some reason the whole chicken or chicken with bones comes out better than the pure chicken meat by itself. You can't believe how quickly things cook and how tender the meat is. I'm looking forward to trying new recipes with this, making more old fashioned type comfort foods, and maybe even trying to make some persian dishes with this that usually take many hours to cook (like gorme sabzi, a stew of fried greens with dried lime and meat).. Wonderful product, very happy I got it."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "It's a pain and a bulky disappointment.", "review_body": "We bought it in November and thought it was the answer to our rice cooker issue. After several months of using it, it's temperamental and the lid won't close after trying for 10 minutes. There is something with the sealing mechanism that is hindering its ability to close when plugged in. A cooking option was not chosen, it was simply plugged in. We're about 2 weeks past the return window so now we're stuck with a bulky kitchen item. Also, the coating at the rim of the lid is flaking off and I found pieces of that in my rice. One of the important features of this cooker was that the food would be free of plastics or coatings, however that was not the case. For the price, it should work flawlessly each time."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Fast, versatile and easy to use", "review_body": "What a great way to save time in cooking! Since I bought the 3-Quart model, there aren't that many accessories available for it yet (like pot cover). For a single person, the 3-qt. size is big enough, but most recipes (a ton of recipe books are available on Kindle) are portioned for the 6-qt. size and have to be scaled down. This thing is incredibly great at making rice and rice dishes, as well as hot cereals and grains like quinoa. Soups, stews and chilis are a breeze. The timer and modes of the unit make flawless pressure-cooking possible. Be careful not to fill the internal pot above the maximum fill line, or you'll make a mess. The whole thing is very well-built and seems like it will last a long time. I am using it to cook more than half of my meals, and that really surprises me. For vegans, this little pot opens up a method for making great vegan dishes quickly and easily. I have also used it to make some really great Thai and Indian curries as well as some Chinese recipes. I even made some bread pudding that turned out great. The internal stainless pot is very solid and easy to clean up (unless you burn something while saut\u00e9ing). Make sure you have adequate liquid in the bottom of the pot when steaming."},

I'm here to say it does an excellent job on both and I'm convinced it will do equally as well with other dishes. Now here's where I thought I might have a problem. When not in use I store the Instant Pot on a shelf next to the cellar stairs. This morning (07-19-2016) one of the three dogs thought it was OK to go poking around the shelf and somehow knocked the Instant Pot off the shelf and down the cellar stairs. FYI the stairs are cast cement. When I heard the racket I got up to investigate and was greeted by three dogs who denied any and all involvement in what had just happened. There at the bottom of the stairs was my Instant Pot with lid off and inner bowl out. My first thought was I'll have to go to Amazon and order a new one and maybe even upgrade to the 8 quart size. Not so fast, lets see if it still works. Brought it in the kitchen and added some water. Plugged it in and it came to life. After a few minutes it came up to pressure and did everything it was supposed to do none the worst for ware. I'm happy, the dogs are happy and corned beef and cabbage tonight."},

It's got a sleek profile, nice to look at, easy to read numbers that light up. But it almost never displays the right weight first time around until you let it stabilize on a number, it holds that number for 5-10 seconds, then you step back on and it will display a different number (normally 3-4lbs less). The other issue here is that once in awhile, it's right the first time, so you go through the whole 30 second exercise to see if it changes. While we've gotten used to it, this is not what we want in a scale, so I'd say keep looking.. You'll know the first reading is off after you get off the scale, wait 5-10 seconds & see if a \"C\" (for correction ?) comes up in the display.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "THE BEST KITCHEN APPLIANCE", "review_body": "I have a lot of kitchen appliances, basically everything you can imagine: vitamix blender, food processor, dehydrator, rice cooker, pressure cooker, waffle iron, juicer, etc. Needless to say my kitchen is full! That's the first plus of the Instant Pot, 3 of my appliances (plus some) are now in 1! More counter space! Yay!. I primarily eat at home and I cook A LOT. I only cook unprocessed, healthy, plant based foods so it can be quite time consuming and difficult at times. I'm a full time student, Mom to 4 pets, I work, have a boyfriend, train on my bike, and practice yoga daily. I'm SUPER busy which is reason number 2 why I decided to give the Instant Pot a go and it hasn't disappointed me! I've only had it for a week and I've already saved hours in the kitchen!. One other benefit that I wasn't planning on is less dishes and easier clean up. I can saut\u00e9 garlic and onions, add in other ingredient, let it boil, then throw on the top and pressure cook it without ever changing pans and in 1/2 the amount of time. This makes my life so much easier!. Without any reservations I can say that the Instant Pot is the best kitchen appliance I have ever owned and I imagine the longer I have it the more I'll love it. I've used it every day since it's arrived, sometimes 3 times a day! I've made split pea soup, steel cut oats, millet porridge, sweet potatoes, rice, lentils, and I even tried my hand at making vegan yogurt for the first time, it was SO EASY and AMAZING! I'm just absolutely blown away with how great this thing is and how easy it is to use!. It's so great that I talked my Dad into getting one and he LOVES it! He's a bachelor who lives in a space that doesn't have an oven, or much of a kitchen right now which makes cooking difficult for obvious reasons. Thanks to the Instant Pot he's eating at home more often and he says he \"doesn't even feel like he's cooking.\". Long story short, everyone should own an Instant Pot! I wish I could give it more than 4 stars! And for the price I got it for on Cyber Monday?!?! I can't even believe it! It's already paid for itself!"},

Beef stew in so little time.  Pea soup so yummy. There are a few tricks to using one so it helps if someone can guide you to the tips..venting, safely adding items, and getting recipes for press cookers.  I had no one that had one so I figured it all out.  As they say it is not rocket science, but it did take me a few tries.  There are tons of recipes now too.  I got used cook books on Amazon to try a few ideas. Our slow pot used to simmer while I was at work...Not now.  I do prep some meals in the AM.  Keep in frig and start this pot right when I get home.  Dinner in an hour that use to take all day.  Some Oatmeal recipes are amazing too. Cleans up fast if you can soak the stainless steel pot for 30 mins. after use.  But I have not had any issues with food sticking. Again, this is different than the old slow pots but well worth the effort if you can just take the time to learn. About a foot high.  Cord comes off for storage.  similar weight to the bigger slow cook pots."},

Just read the manual, look up recipes and ideas online, and try something simple like beans or rice for your first try. You'll get use to how it works. It's an awesome \"toy\"!

I've cooked a variety of foods in it, and everything I've cooked has turned out beautifully. I have not found the inside container difficult to clean. After washing in hot soapy water, I put a little bit of water in the bottom, sprinkle it with \"Bar-Keepers Friend powder\" and use a dish cloth to clean the entire inside of the pot. After rinsing and drying, it looks brand new and no scratches at all."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "A lot of fun. very versatile and easy to clean.", "review_body": "This is a winner at the $52 price point I got it for in November 2017.  I tend now to spend too much time cooking because it is just fun and satisfying to achieve so much in one pot. I also turn out too many calories... again because it is fun and so easy to clean up. I am still in the learning and experimenting phase, but have made some incredible soups just using up meats from the freezer and grains from the cupboards.  Today I made country ribs with homemade bbq sauce, all in the pot, from browning the meat and the onions, stirring up a bbq sauce from scratch. It turned out so perfectly I may never again waste money at a rib shack, where the chance of getting dried up ribs is pretty high. The 3 qt size works well for one person with leftovers for 1-2 more meals, or with soups, to freeze a couple of pints in addition to eating all you want for a couple of days. Sauteing is a little tricky because the bottom of the pan is slightly convex, so if you use only a small quantity of oil, it goes to the edges leaving the center without oil. I will shop for silicone grip pot holders that pinch in order to manage the hot stainless pot for tasks like stabilizing while stirring, and draining the extra oil needed before progressing from saute to pressure mode."},

Fall-apart, tender pot roast with vegetables in 1 hour. Meat comes out very tender and the vegetables aren't mushy just firm and cooked. Tender chicken, rice and vegetable dishes in 25 minutes. No added fat or salt needed you only need to add the right combo of veggies to et the taste you'll love.  Meat comes out tender and juicy every time. Only trick for me is how much liquid to add when cooking rice with vegetables and meat. I've found the more vegetables I add, I need less liquid to get the rice just right. clean up is simple. the stainless steel inner cooker is removable and cleans up like it non stick (easy cleanup probably has more to due with the cooking process) Wish I'b bought one of these years ago!"},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "High quality double-wall stainless steel insert makes this Pressure Cooker an excellent option", "review_body": "I chose the Instant Pot pressure cooker because of the stainless steel insert. I generally avoid non-stick surfaces, choosing an iron skillet for most of my frying needs, and I did not want a pressure cooker with a non-stick surface. This Instant Pot cooker is a bit more expensive than many of the options with non-stick pots, but I think it's worth it. I am extremely impressed by the quality of the pot included. Most rice cookers and that sort of device have very thin pots which commonly leads to burning of food. This pot has a double walled base such as you would find on an expensive stove top cooking pot.. I have only made three things in the pot, so I cannot speak to the longevity of the cooker. However, I can say that the pot works exactly as you would hope that it does. First I made beef stew according to a recipe I found online. The meat was browned in the pot with the lid off and then other ingredients added and the entire dish then pressure cooked. It did a fine job, and the seemingly ubiquitous step of removing the meat and adding liquid to deglaze the pot caused all the food to be stirred off the bottom and the flavor included in the dish. Cleanup was a breeze. Then I made stew, using a very similar process. First the meat was browned in the pot, removed, and liquid added to deglaze. Then the remaining ingredients were added back and pressure cooked. Black beans which had only been soaked for an hour were cooked to tender, along with the meat, in 30 minutes on the \"Beans and Soup\" setting. Finally I cooked garbanzo beans for hummus. Those had soaked overnight and rinsed, and the same \"beans and soup\" setting used to cook. I put the rack in and placed the soaked beans in a steamer insert. They were tender and made great hummus after only 30 minutes of pressure cooking. (Note: soaked beans should not take as long as unsoaked beans, but I wanted them very soft for hummus). Note that getting up to pressure takes 12-15 minutes, depending on how much water and other ingredients are in the pot. cooking time is on top of that.. The device makes virtually no noise unless you have it set to \"steam\" (the weight is turned one way for steaming and the other way for pressure).. I never scrubbed the pot after any of these meals, although with the smooth stainless steel, you certainly could do so without destroying the surface.. I would definitely recommend this pot if you're considering an electronic pressure cooker. Staying away from non-stick and getting the better quality insert pot is, in my opinion, worth the extra $30 over other options."},

The read out is very large and I am getting a little older and don't like to put my glasses on in the morning.  Over the first few months the scale worked very well.  It seemed like every time I stepped on the scale the number was either the same or lower than it was the previous day.  Then the Etekcity scale started to malfunction.  Over the past 2 months every time I step on the scale the number is the same or higher.  I was so mystified I had to bend lower to make sure I wasn't misreading the (formerly) easily readable display.

I know this sounds crazy, that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it\u2019s the worse scale ever made. If they were each consistently up or down I could just weigh myself and deduct the weight or add the weight, but they\u2019re not even consistently inconsistent. In addition,  if you weigh a dumbbell  on it, it is usually consistently correct. So apparently this scale is designed to weigh dumbbells and not humans. I know this sounds crazy, again that is why I am calling it the worse scale ever made. The amount of positive reviews are inexplicable.

The Plenty rolls are 52-2 ply sheets per roll @ $19.31 per 24 roll case. I found Brighton rolls elsewhere which are 85-2 ply sheets per roll @ $35.99 for a case of 30. So do the math, Plenty sheets are 11\"x10.4\" at 52 rolls gives you 540.8 linear inches of sheer wiping power. The Brighton is 11\"x8.5\" at 85 sheets which equals 722 linear inches. So even though the Brighton sheets are shorter you still get more bang per roll. We never use 100% paper towel absorbancy. The Plenty was costing us $.015 while the Brighton rolls are $.014 per sheet. Not much you would think, but when the average user spools 2-3 towels per wipe up and a single napkin is used 7 days per week x3 meals per person, you can see the savings add up."},

My mother always used a pressure cooker, but the noise  used to drive me crazy.  This is sooo quiet, efficient and easy to use.  Plug and use.  You can saute your aromatics prior to starting the pressure cooker.  You can easily do manual times.  We are vegetarians and I am able to make our ethnic cuisine in minutes using this appliance. There are literally hundreds of recipes online.  I made black beans and garbanzo beans without soaking in less than an hour ( cook and cool down time).  Split beans in less time than that.  I have steamed potatoes, made steel cut oats  as well as apple sauce. I am still trying new recipes.  I even made pasta in a rush before my husband and I went out for the kids. It has the convenience of a slow cooker \"dump and forget\"  but allows you to do all the cooking in one pot and faster.  Stainless steel interior easy to clean.  Between this appliance and my Vitamix, I am in heaven.  If you like to cook, don't like slaving over a hot stove or oven and often are needing something fast - this is your appliance."},

I am quite impressed with this machine.. First, rice. I did a split test on this, comparing rice cooked in the Instant Pot with my stovetop version. I'm not picky about my rice, but I gotta say, the Instant Pot did it better, albeit not much faster, but better and without any fuss or guessing.. Second, yogurt. Can't say I'm super impressed. First attempt was a failure. I kept checking the temperature and found that Instant Pot quit heating at 170 degrees F, 10 degrees below boiling. I don't believe it was quite hot enough. The second attempt was much more successful - instead of using Instant Pot to heat the milk, I used the stovetop and let the milk and starter incubate in the Instant Pot ... for eight hours. Took longer, but whatever. Tastes great.. Pressure cooker. A whole chicken in 20 minutes. What's not to love about that? No, really, what's not to love? My chill is ON at dinner time now.. Steam. It worked. I wish I'd left my frozen veggies in the steamer longer, but we're not strangers to cold food. (Check it: Left over rice, left over chicken, steamed veggies in a bowl topped with a little Trader Joe's Masala in a jar. Good eats.). Haven't tried it with multigrain (wild rice) or slow cooker or porridge, but I'm not worried at all, and I'm getting to it. But first, another 20-minute chicken, please!"},

The little silver button that is supposed to pop up to show that it's locked never pops and I end up having to take the lid on and off a couple times before I can get it to work. It always works eventually but slows things down by 15 minutes each time because I have to wait the appropriate preheat time to see if it locks and then tinker with it and then when it finally does lock it has to preheat again then cook. After that it's AMAZING and I'm in love. This has just be an annoyance up till this point but I bought the product so that I could set it on timer while I work and if it doesn't end up locking and cooking on it's own that will not work out for me. I'll update my comments if I can get any answers from the company as to why it is doing this and how it can be addressed."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Great For Bone Broth", "review_body": "I was going to give this as a gift to my daughter but after reading all the positive reviews I decided to keep it myself. But while I was reading the manual and recipes that came with the unit, I wasn't so sure I made the right decision. I will be the first to say they are poorly written and not fun to read. I then went online and started searching for recipes for the Instant Pot and saw the fun and incredible things that can be done with it.. I am very familiar with pressure canning. This is something completely different. Pressure canning requires 30-90 minutes to pressure seal a jar and make it safe to store. The instant Pot is measured in a lot less time for cooking an item. White rice in 8 minutes? ( By the way, no one will walk by and lift the lid to see whats cooking...one of my pet peeves when I'm cooking rice.). Everyone on the reviews mentions a \"learning curve\". They are very correct, but they are fun lessons and easy to catch on.. If you are into making bone broth, this is the perfect tool. Instead of simmering the bones for 12-36 hours on the stove, the Instant Pot does it in 2-3 hours for the most nutritious bone broth. Just pack the Instant pot to the fill line with chicken, beef or any bones (pre cooked or fresh) and fill to the same line with water and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. Set on high pressure for 2-3 hours. Very good for healing broken bones or any joint pain.. I now feel good about ordering another one to give to my daughter."},

First, as a slow cooker, I've just about written it off. It never gets hot enough, and even on high for 8-9 hrs, it will not slow cook a chicken for me. In my ancient crockpot (that finally fell apart) it would be falling off the bone in 4-5 hrs. So then I tried pressure cooking more often. My meat doesn't seem to be tender enough, but at least it's cooked. Until today. Today the pot acted like it was working, I heard the thing come up to pressure, but when I went to serve dinner, the chicken was still raw! I don't know why, because the pot came to pressure and started counting down the time, then released the pressure naturally. At a loss. Don't know if I have a dud??"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Highly Satisfied Customer!", "review_body": "This review is for my Instant Pot IP-DUO60. The IP-DUO60 is a little powerhouse machine. It functions as a pressure cooker, a slow cooker, a steamer, and so much more. This is my first pressure cooker so I wasn\u2019t sure of how easy it would be to use, time settings, and what you can and can\u2019t cook. I have had a hard time writing this review because how much I love it. I can\u2019t decide which is the best features to tell you about. So I will just go with everything I have done so far with it.. Rice is 12 minutes to cook, Veggies are 3-4 to steam from fresh. You can even put frozen chicken in the pressure cooker and it will be ready in roughly 20 min. No more thawing out chicken.. The crock pot function is awesome too. I freezer cook so I can put it in first thing in the morning and I will have dinner ready when I walk through the door. But why is the IP-DUO60 different than a normal crock pot? \uf04a You can set it to come on an hour (or more) after you walk out the door and it won\u2019t sit on warm for 2 hours and be overcooked! It will just be finishing up when you get home. (I only do this if it is still totally frozen \u2013 NEVER with thawed raw meat). Pros:. \u2022 7 tools in 1 - Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Saute/Browning, Yogurt Maker, Steamer & Warmer. \u2022 Stainless Steel removable interior pot. \u2022 Locking lid with Pressure valve.. Cons:. \u2022 At this time, I have not found a con to report. I will come back an update my review accordingly if the need arises.. Final Words:. I have put my crock pot up for special occasions now (things that are too large to go in the Instant Pot). I love the multi functionality of the Instant Pot. You can brown your meat right in the pot before slow cooking. LESS MESS is BEST! I am continuing to use the Instant Pot and learning about everything this machine can do. But what I do know, it will stay with me for a long time!"},
{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "cool down time unless you release the pressure", "review_body": "I am a new user of InstantPot but I have learned a few basics that don't seem to be in the directions. First there is a 4 HOUR default when you pick \"Pressure Cook\". You have to count down with the \"minus\" sign to (say) 10 mins. for chicken in chunks. Then it takes 10 mins. to warm up, then it will begin the cook time. There is about a 10 or 15 min. cool down time unless you release the pressure. (I recommend tongs to do this as it spits a little). So \"instant\" isn't so instant. But if you want that tender pot roast in record time compared to a slow cooker or in the oven for hours, it is great. Also, be sure to use water or other liquid acording to directions which I don't if I am cooking an oven pot roast. I see raves about hard boiled eggs: I get mind done on the stove in less time than it takes the InstantPot to warm up. There is a great Lava Cake recipe on-line and that worked out deliciously. (Not the one in the recipe book which only makes one.) I like it, but it isn't the end all that the reviews say. Maybe I'll post agian after more than 4 usages."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Best Appliance I own", "review_body": "I have had this product for a couple of years now.  When I first got it there weren't many recipes to be found to cook from.  But now!  Recipes are everywhere- facebook, on the website, and on many other sites.  Though my Instapot has many features, I usually just cook under pressure for the 30 minute default time.  Meat always falls off the bone, and seasoning is embedded in the food making everything delicious.  I have used it so much that the stainless steel liner is just now showing scrub marks and one or two tiny pitted places.  The other thing I am happy about with the new revolution in everyone getting one of these? Parts are readily available.  I can order a new liner, a glass lid, a new gasket for the pressure lid..love that.  I like this pressure cooker a bit better than the usual old school ones mostly because I have a steam vent that can be manually operated.  Also, it keeps food on warm when the cycle is finished, and gives you options (many many options) for controlling your process.  When I purchased this I was planning a complete kitchen remodel.  This was the handiest thing during that time.  It is my go-to appliance more often than not, and I still try new things all the time.  Mine has seen hard use for more than 2 years now and is still going strong.  You get a lot of bang for your buck here, and I highly, highly recommend this product to anyone.  From the simplest of recipes like pot roast to the more complicated recipes you will love the one pot convenience, the speedy cook time, and the easy cleanup.  I had researched several of these products before purchasing, and I am very happy with my choice.  Get it!"},

As a mom of 6, I'm very busy and this takes a lot of pressure (no pun intended) off of me at mealtime. I have but one problem with it and that is the fact that it's not a good slow cooker. At all. I have tried it a few times and it has not done a good job. Low is more like warm, medium is very low, and high is more like a smidge above low. I have cooked things all day on high and the meat still isn't tender. The good thing is that it's a pressure cooker, so I just pressure cooker it at that point. But I wish it worked better. I bought this so that I could get rid of my rice cooker and slow cooker. But I wish I had kept my slow cooker now, because sometimes I just want to slow cook things and not have to worry with pressure cooking it too. As a rice cooker it does beautifully. If you are considering getting this appliance, I highly recommend it. But hold on to your slow cooker until you know if you need it. And check out Pinterest for recipes. There are tons out there!"},

They're basically a soft, rubberized fabric. Unlike plastic or vinyl protectors, it isn't stiff and stretches a little with the fabric. It's quiet when you lay on it and isn't hot to sleep on.  With a bottom sheet over it, you can't even tell it's there.. The fabric side faces up, so I'm glad it's washable if it gets wet. The rubber side faces down to protect the mattress. I haven't washed ours yet, so I can't comment on how well it cleans up.. The sides are made of stretchy fabric that wraps all the way around the bottom of the mattress. It fits very securely and there's enough material down the side to fit a pillow top or an extra mattress pad easily. It also fits slightly irregular size mattresses like my futon.. I was so pleased with the one for my futon that I ordered another for my son's twin size bed. Both have worked out great."},

But I was intrigued by the reviews I read and videos I saw. The price was not unreasonable given its versatility so I went for it. I have not been disappointed, and have now given away my pressure cooker and slow cooker, saving space. A big advantage is being able to go from pressure cooking to slow cooking or visa-versa in the same utensil, as well as being able to brown ingredients in the same pot when slow cooking (this usually has to be done in a separate pan on the stove top).  And, when pressure cooking, you don't have to stand around and wait for the gauge to get to the right place and then adjust the heat. This happens automatically, though you still have to take a stab at timing (there's a manual to guide that) to ensure you cook it the way you want. The rice cooker makes wonderful, fluffy rice. I gave my traditional rice cooker away years ago because it took up space and was not any better than what I could do stove-top. This cooker does what it says, and since our family is mostly eating brown rice these days, which takes longer to steam, this pot is a wonderful time-saver.. At some point I may buy an additional liner pot so that I can slow or pressure cook one item and then set it aside as I make another part of the meal such as rice. I already purchased the glass lid that can be used for slow cooking so you can keep an eye on how things are cooking.. This cooker also makes yogurt and can pressure can small jars of food. I have tried neither of these yet but plan to do so at some time in the future."},

Also, there are problems with the diverters.. Instant Pot\u2019s clueless CS, told me that this wasn\u2019t a problem. I told him it was. He sent me 2 links. After I checked the first one, and returned to the on-line chat, the second link was gone.. Is it too much to ask, how to contain the steam, without doing any damage? Maybe a class-action lawsuit, about damaged ceilings and cabinets, will solve the problem.. This is 2018, design a pressure cooker that doesn\u2019t have this problem..

The stainless steel pot was easy to clean and they have great links for recipes on their web site. I prefer stainless steel to the non stick coatings because I don't think the non stick surfaces are safe health wise. Did you know you can make cheese cake in a pressure cooker! If you go to the manufactures web page to register your unit it will ask you for the model number and serial number. The model number is on a silver sticker on the side of the unit. The serial number however is on the bottom of the unit on a piece of tape. I only mention this because I had a hard time finding it and I was not able to find the serial number location in the manual. Other than that the instructions are easy to understand and in my opinion there was a lot of thought put into the design of this unit. Overall it was a very positive experience cooking with this unit and I look forward to using it on a regular basis! One other thing. The cover has arrows and a lock and unlock glyph to assist the user in installing and removing the cover. However the glyphs are black on black and not easy to see without the use of a flash light. So I took some white house paint and using a Q-tip just dabbed some white paint on the arrows to make it easier to install the lid and lock it. I also emailed the manufacturer and suggested that they highlight the arrows to make it easier to install the lid and lock it. But overall this is the best pressure cooker I have ever used and am really excited about preparing meals on a regular basis with it!"},

I already own stove top pressure cookers and am not new to pressure cooking. I was hesitant to add one more appliance to the already crowded counter space but after seeing all the videos online I decided I could put it to good use. I cook vegetarian Indian food and this works out very well. I use the stackable cooking vessels that I use with my regular pressure cooker in this to make rice and another item at the same time. I invested in the taller steam racks so my rice vessel does not touch whatever is cooking at the bottom. A steamer basket from IKEA makes nice steamed vegetables. The most advantage for me is using a single vessel and not having to clean the stove (I am a moderately messy cook and Indian food helps facilitate that). The inner pot is easy to clean. After 6 months I plan to get the smaller 3 quart one as we are only two people in the house that don't eat much and don't like eating leftovers."},

I highly recommend the Instant Pot 8 qt. 7 in 1 pressure cooker.  We are only two, but I make enough to have left overs for several days and also to freeze a quart of whatever I make to have on a day that I am just too busy.

And the wide variety of things you can cook with this little powerhouse is incredible: aside from the usual type of meals you would expect, you are able to make yogurt, cheesecake, puddings, the list is only limited by your imagination!. And the clean up is so easy! This mini is small and easy to handle for cleaning: it\u2019s not huge or heavy making it difficult to clean. Take out the liner ( stainless steel), hot soapy water - clean up done! Quick wipe down of the unit- done. It\u2019s very easy to clean the seal, so it\u2019s easier to clean up the IPot and liner than scrub out pots and pans. It\u2019s like having a vacation with great food..

The rubber ring that seals the pot picks up cooking smells that transfer to your next dish. If you think cumin from a lentil curry ruins pea soup (it does) this product is not for you.

After spending $100 on the unit itself, I'm not really enthusiastic about spending more money on extra rings. Otherwise this thing is amazing and I love it.

Then my cousin told me he bought one of these and really likes it. So I was willing to give it a try and ordered a 3 quart version. Got delivered this afternoon and made dinner - mint rice pilaf - same recipe o use in the pressure cooker. In fact the rice cooked in the instapot turned out much better than the regular one I make using my pressure cooker on the stove. The 3 quart size is big enough for us and I am planning on trying various recipes soon.. The main thing I like about it is, I can set the setting and walk away and don't have to check on it multiple times or don't have to turn the stove off. Perfect to set it up and go for a shower and come and my food is ready. Happy so far and I am sure I will use it a lot.. I also paid $4 extra and got the warranty not sure it is helpful but thought I will get it anyways.. Now I need to search for more vegetarian recipes online and start cooking."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "Stay away!!!", "review_body": "I bought this thinking it would save me a lot of trouble and room in the kitchen due to its many supposed functions but it's caused a lot more trouble than anything else.. First: note that you can use this to cook rice, but you have to use the pressure cook setting and rice does not come out as good as in a rice cooker.. Also note that this is NOT autosensing. You would think that the different buttons for \"beans\" or \"soup\" actually do different things, but they don't.. In fact, you will actually either burn your food or undercook it.. The temperature of the slow cooker for example, does not get high enough, even on the \"high\" setting. I've tried to use the setting to cook things for 6-10 hours and have been left with barely heated through food. (Trust me, I'm not doing anything wrong).. Actually, this whole thing doesn't work. Any recipe I follow specifically mentioning the instant pot burns the bottom or comes out wrong in some way. Mine doesn't seem defective; it just seems like a really crappy product for the price you pay. Save yourself the money and stay far away from the instant pot!!"},

I have now decide to \"bite the bullet\" and take the loss and buy a different one.  First, the instruction book that came with it had recipes for mouth-watering family favorites like TURNIP CAKE.  Seriously?  And, despite the buttons on the front for different kinds of foods, every recipe's instructions were for MANUAL settings and were quite involved.  I don't know about other people, but my point in buying is to accomplish a healthy meal easily and simply.  So I watched for recipe books to come out, and finally they started being released.  But guess what.  Their recipes were for MANUAL settings.  Really?  Are those buttons just decorative adornments?  So I contacted Customer Service about a refund and explained what I had encountered.  Their attitude could be summed as \"Tough luck, sucka!\"  They did not offer any information about the buttons.  I woud have chosen fewer stars but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt as a technologically correct product.  Just not why I buy a modern pressure cooker."},

I initially ordered this for a famil", "review_body": "This will be my 3rd Instant Pot order!  Not because there was something wrong but because this little appliance is soooooo amazing.  I initially ordered this for a family Christmas present a couple years ago as the price was severely cut and I thought it would make a nice rice cooker at least.  One of those spontaneous buys that turned out to be surprisingly GREAT!  The first thing we made with it was a soup and I cannot express enough how amazing the flavor was (as if it were cooking all day on slow but only took less than an hour).....I then moved on to throwing any and everything in the pot and again it created magic soup!  One day, we were depleted of food in the house and all I had was a bag of asparagus, broccoli, butternut squash and a severely hungry stomach so I threw the veggies in with a few seasonings/olive oil and to my surprise, probably one of the best soups (they are all great) we've made in the pot.  We have also made lots of rice in the pot and our kids prefer this rice over stove cooking and it does seem to be much moister (I'm grain free).  So, the following Christmas, I gifted this to my mother-in-law who is older now and has pretty serious diabetes - She loves it!  This year, I gifted the pot to my sister who has a very limited budget, little time being a single parent working long hours.....she too has now become an Instant Pot fan (and she has an impressive culinary background).  This is just the most amazing appliance ever!. Pros:. Pre-programmable buttons for different dishes. Very little time to make delicious foods. Compact enough to store in most cabinets. Cons:. I really don't have any but cleaning the lid (rubber rings) however this is to be expected with 'any' appliance, cooking tools."},

Not only do I feel like I got a steal, but I do think that I would've been just as pleased had I payed full price. I'm very frugal, so to me, that says a lot about the quality and usefulness of this product. I use it a couple times a week, thanks to the myriad of free recipes on food blogs. I've also adapted some of my favorite recipes to cook in it. It's a wonderful luxury item and a worthy investment to those who try to cook all of their meals at home.

Until it went on sale!  Then, I had no excuse not to buy one.  I used it for the first time today.  It's incredibly easy to use, just read the directions and you're all set.  The only issue that I had is that it makes no noise. After I put my pork roast in the instant pot, I set the timer and stared at it for a few minutes, waiting.  There was no noise and the outside of the pot was at room temperature, so I assumed that it was not working.  I checked on it several times that hour and it remained quiet and cool to the touch.  When the time indicator reached zero, I let it cool down...and my pork roast was perfect!  This is my newest favorite kitchen gadget."},

I did think that the directions were a little overwhelming and confusing, when really they could have been much more simple.  This is a very easy product to use.. Mine came with the lid seal in place and the only thing I had to assemble was the little water condensation catcher...I don't even remember where that went?  After that, it was more important to read the recipes and the difference between quick release and slow release. My advice is to find a good youtube tutorial if you are having trouble.  I've seen on some FB pages people really screwing up there food... I'm not really sure how that happens. Just follow the directions.  Whole chicken is so easy, 3 -4 pound chicken, season, add 1 cup water or broth, then set for 25 min on manual, and walk away. You let it slow release, it's amazingly easy.  Try the poached eggs!. I still have a lot to experiment with, but so far, this thing is awesome. Loving it."},

The pulled pork and chicken she made in this thing came out amazing. She has cooked rice and used it in \"keep warm\" mode for the cheese for a party we had. This thing is pretty cool. You just set it and forget it. I could even use it if she didn't cook. It has a few musical sounds that indicate the status of the cooker, like when it is done and when it is set. I hear these sounds and get hungry haha. Overall this was a GREAT purchase and so much better than any stove top pressure cooker. It is fully automatic."},

Here are my notes on how to make it.. Set it to Manual >  240 min (4 hours). Timer  0:10. High pressure. Beef. Use joints & bones & ankle & trim / cheap cuts of meat - gives it flavor. It's called fond.. Put in the bones.. Fill it with cold water to cover bones. Don't fill it up all the way.. Add a little vinegar. Makes the water acidic. It leeches the minerals out of the bone.. Don't use salt it because the liquid will evaporate.. Chicken. Use chicken backs & knuckle bones.

They had great reviews on amazon, but I had to delve deeper.  I googled how well microfiber cleans bacteria and saw studies that said after a bacterial swab test of surfaces cleaned with traditional cleaner and cloth vs. microfiber the results were nearly identical.  Sold!  Worth a shot.  At $10 for 24 I can have a little basket in the kitchen and each bathroom.  Just wet, wipe, toss into laundry!  And the faucets and surfaces squeak and shine.  I use them in the kitchen and bathroom.  I reserve the yellow ones for the toilet seat.  I use a Lysol wipe for the obvious stuff (teenage boys, you know what I mean...), but if its not too bad, I'll go over with a wet microfiber.  If done daily cleaning is a snap!  Literally seconds.  And I hate to clean.  I usually wait til things are obviously in need of a go over, but since getting these cloths I actually look for things to wet and wipe.  Just did the inside of my microwave (zapped a little dish of water and lemon juice for a few minutes) then wiped out with the microfiber cloths.

They worked great with zero moisture penetrating the mattress. The cover has a nice felt like top layer which absorbs some of the moisture but underneath that is a plasticized layer that is impermeable..

Yesterday I used it to make hard boiled eggs. Though I used to make eggs on the stove top, they are easy to make in the Instant Pot and they peel SO easily. After the eggs were done, I rinsed the pot and made potatoes.  I quartered red potatoes and cooked them on saut\u00e9 with some herbs, beef broth,  and cocout oil.  I added some peeled carrots, cut in half.  I then cooked them on high pressure for 9 minutes.  They came out delicious and were such a welcome addition to our meal.  My children said they were their most favorite potatoes I've ever made.. Some of my favorite recipes for the Instant Pot include herbed chicken,  one pot pasta in meat sauce, and chili.  There are lots of recipes for chicken, beef, fish, and beans in healthy sauces that you can find on the Internet.  My favorite recipes were collected from various Facebook groups for Instant Pot users.. I was slightly intimidated when the Instant Pot first arrived, but I've since become adept at following recipes and even creating my own.  I've taken my Instant Pot foods to potlucks and received rave reviews.  I feel like being adventurous is easy with the Instant Pot and I've definitely tried many new things.  All were good,  most were great, and most were healthy.. I haven't cooked any desserts or yogurt in the Instant Pot, but I know that's something people use it for often.  I am planning to buy the new, larger, Instant Pot, and keep two."},

I have every kitchen gadget imaginable - so I hesitated on getting yet another kitchen toy. I have to say how incredibly happy I am that I did. This is the most amazing kitchen product I've ever used (apologies to my other beloved appliances that have been moved aside). Even my husband has decided to start using it too because he's seen me have so much fun with it - and has thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food I've been making.  I wasn't sure what size to buy - 6 qt or 8 qt - as there are only 2 of us to cook for. It's the perfect size. The 6 qt makes about 4 good sized servings. I've tried at least 5 of the 7 functions (still have to cook eggs and rice, jury is out on yoghurt at the moment). The best dish so far has been Pho. Never would I have ever tried making Pho - but it is fabulous using this pot (look up Instant Pot Faux Pho on the internet). I did buy extra gaskets at others recommendations. This looks to be a pretty sturdy piece of equipment for the home kitchen, but it isn't commercial grade (the outer jacket would have to be much sturdier).  I imagine this could very well be the only cooking appliance needed in a tiny home, camping trailer or other small kitchen.  I'm doing most of my cooking in this pot alone now.

I thought I might still be able to cook upstairs with this and decided to give it a shot. I gotta say this has been the best thing to come out of this household disaster. This one appliance makes it possible to do a one-pot meal even with recipes requiring browning, sauteeing, simmering, and pressure cooking. I received it only 3 days ago and prepared 2 meals with it. Both were ridiculously delicious and tasted as if I'd spent hours cooking. The UI couldn't be any easier and there are a lot of electric pressure cooker cookbooks out there for newbies like myself. I was thrilled to see my subscription to Kindle Unlimited gave me access to at least 10 of them. I'm now regretting my previous purchase of a crockpot a few months ago as this appliance will do that job, too. Tonight I made the best mushroom pot roast I've ever served. The appliance seared and browned the chuck roast beautifully, sauteed the onions, garlic and mushroom like a champ, and cooked the tough meat and potatoes liked I'd spent hours on it. No knife was needed as the meat and potatoes were fork-tender with 90 minutes of cooking. I was able to make an amazing gravy with the cooking liquid by removing the meat and potatoes and adding a corn starch/water slurry. I put the meat, potatoes, and gravy aside and then sauteed a pound of mushrooms in the pot, reducing the liquid and getting a nice browning on them. I put the meat/potatoes/gravy back in with the sauteed mushrooms and simmered for a few minutes. The results were incredible. I'm seriously in love with this electric pressure cooker."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Best Kitchen Appliance Ever-- while it lasts.", "review_body": "UPDATED 8/2017 I've dropped this 5 star rating to 2. It is a PHENOMENAL product. BUT IT DOESN'T LAST! I've come to totally rely on this appliance as much as my old rice cooker, steamer, and crockpot combined. Each of those lasts 5-15 years. This lasted me TWO. Not okay with this.. I have recommended this pot to numerous others, and just bought one for my mother-in-law getting ready to serve a mission. You seriously could get away with having this tool as your only cooking option for your kitchen. I wish I'd had it during our remodel!  I seriously do not need my old crockpot or pressure cooker, and only rarely use my old rice cooker/steamer anymore; pretty much only when I'm already using this guy for something I'm wanting to serve over rice. I take it camping and it's come in so handy for days when we're exhausted and just don't want to wait for hot coals to eat. I'm planning to see if I can just boil water in it on the sautee setting for making dehydrated meals this year. I can't imagine it wouldn't work perfectly for that. I could also just bring whole rolled oats and make hot cereal using the \"porridge\" function, too.. PROS. I LOVE that the lid locks on (no more spills in the car when transporting food! Hooray!). Love the carrying handle. Stainless steel pot makes cleanup SO easy. You can even use those metal scrubbers on it for tough burnt-on food... not that I ever burn my food.... 7 tools in 1. SO versatile it's crazy.. Saute feature is fantastic for browning meat before slow cooking, but also means you can make fried rice/rice pilafs in here. Or evaporate off any extra liquid from your dish at the end of cooking. Or brown your pulled pork at the end for that nice BBQ feel. Love it!. Seal/vent feature on the lid means you can lock in moisture for pressure cooking/slow-cooking something you don't want to dry out, OR you can open it up and let the liquids evaporate as you slow cook if it's turning out a bit too wet.. I love the timer function. You can put in your frozen ingredients in the morning, set the timer to start cooking in the afternoon, and have dinner done by the time you come home. Trust me, it's worth your time to read the user manual!. Pressure cooking ability means frozen meat isn't a deal breaker at dinner time. Throw it in anyway, it will be done in an hour or less (depending on what you're making). So awesome.. You can easily switch from one setting to another. Slow cook your dinner and find it's dinner time & not done? Pressure cook it the rest of the way. Pressure cooked meal turn out too moist? Turn it on saute and let the liquid evaporate out.. CONS. It only lasts a year or two. Something with a beautiful stainless steel pot, great quality exterior, shouldn't be disposable! I've had mine going on two years and it just stopped working. No warning, just dead. I've emailed the company but I've had many other friends with the same issue and they say there's a reason the warranty is only one year."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "An extremely worthwhile addition to your kitchen!", "review_body": "Though we've had a 12qt stovetop pressure cooker for years, I was always terrified of using it because I was convinced I'd mess up and cause an explosion. While the Instant Pot has significantly less volume, we picked one up because it allows me to assist with making meals without worrying as much. It's been a fantastic item to have around for making stocks, quick meals, and even soft boiled eggs (which I love because I hate making them the standard way -- just use the IP's steam function for 2-3 minutes!).. Since the Instant Pot operates at a slightly lower PSI than stovetop pressure cookers, it does require increasing the cooking time slightly to compensate. Thankfully tons of recipes are readily available online that have been adjusted to appropriate cooking times for this device if you don't feel confident about modifying the times yourself.. That said, we compared our Duo v2 against our friend's Duo v1 after noticing it seemed like it took a bit to come to pressure and that it was running out of water when making meals unlike with our friend's unit. There are a couple physical differences like the cord and trivet, and they performed at different cooking speeds. We placed into each four eggs straight from the fridge in the accompanying trivet along with a cup of water and set them to steam for two minutes. The v1 got to pressure 31 seconds faster and ultimately finished 45 seconds before the v2. After cooling the eggs in ice baths for about 10 minutes, the results were close enough though the eggs from our v2 were slightly more cooked than the v1.. I don't know if this is just our unit or a difference between the v1 and the v2 models, but I would still recommend the Instant Pot for quick, easy, and delicious meals."},

I've never owned a pressure cooker before, but I was in the market for a slow cooker, so I felt this was a solid purchase to make. We've cooked a variety of items in the pressure cooker, such as corned beef, short ribs, pork ribs, chili, bone broth, all of which came out wonderful (I highly recommend making short ribs). It was so nice to be able to brown my meats in the same pan that I use for the pressure/slow cooker. The slow cooker works great; I've never owned a slow cooker that had a timer that not only counts down and will switch to warm when done, but it'll also tell me how long it's been keeping the food warm inside. My husband uses it all the time to make rice (brown and jasmine). The only function we haven't gotten around to using in the 6 months we've owned it is the yogurt function, mostly because I've never made my own yogurt and I mostly use the Instant Pot for dinner. The vessel is easy to clean and guests always inquire about it as it sits on my counter top (it stands fairly tall imo).  The photo attached is what's in the slow cooker right now - a 4lb bone-in portion of pork shoulder."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Just go ahead and pull the trigger on this one, you wont be sorry.", "review_body": "I have a friend that is constantly talking about how great a pressure cooking is, I was skeptical... I stand corrected, I love this thing... best kitchen gadget I have bought in years.. The one function that got me to pull the trigger on this was the yogurt function, that was the first thing I made in it and have done a second batch since.. both turned out great.  A gallon of yogurt for the price of a gallon of milk... cant beat it. (This thing will pay for itself.). I can make an entire gallon of yogurt at one time with WAY less mess and hassle than the way I did it before.. I am one of those folks that always tosses the veg and meat trimmings into the freezer, then once I cant fit anything else Ill break out the giant stock pot and make a large batch of stock and freeze it into bags.. By the time all is said and done its a 24 hour process and there it a good deal of cleanup, since getting the pressure cooker I have simplified the process.... as soon as I have enough bits and pieces of veg and chicken or whatever.... to make a batch in the Ipot... in it all goes & 30 min on high pressure from frozen... and amazing stock, the much smaller batches make for much easier cleanup and the quality is soooo there.. Made some of the best pork ragu ever in 30 min instead of 3 hours. When it comes to meats, depending on what you make its a one or 2 step process. Cheaper cuts cook to fork tender in a few min compared to the 3 hours it takes the collegian to break down when going low and slow. If you want browning most of the time its going to take some oven/broiler time, but honestly who cares.. I'm in.. A couple of minor bad bits... you have to (like most pressure cookers) occasionally change the silicone seal... however good luck finding one. I did contact the manufacturer before buying this & they said they will be available again in about 6 weeks (from time of writing). Sometimes the pressure indicator sticks in the up position, but its not that big a deal. The unit should turn off after it scalds for the yogurt function rather than go to warm. I would of preferred an 8qt option rather than 6.. but its adequate.. If you are one of those that whines about stainless over non-stick, keep moving, nothing to see here... there are other brands available, for the ease of browning in SS over NS, I dont mind a soak in the sink on the rare occasion it needs it.. None of these things add up to much, the big tell for me is, would I buy it again? Absolutely! Just go ahead and pull the trigger on this one, you wont be sorry."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Good Bye Stove!", "review_body": "This might honestly be the best purchase I've made in a long time.. Since buying this pressure cooker, (I think 1-2 weeks ago, tops), I have made everything from chicken wings, pulled pork sandwhiches, pot roast, beef short rib, 2 kinds of chicken drumsticks and chicken soup!. That is a ton of food that I would normally not try because of low laborious the process is so laborious but this machine makes everything so easy. I'm cooking faster, more frequently and with way less clean-up.. Couple of things to note:. 1. Sometimes it takes a bit of wiggling around to get the lid on. Which would be fine, except it makes an annoying chiming sound everytime.. 2. It takes about 10-15 minutes to come up to high pressure and about 20-25 minutes for Natural Release.. 3. From my expereince, the cook times are about 1 minute too high. I just adjust to achieve maximum tenderness.. 4. I wish that I had 2 of these bad boys for the side dishes but it's easy to cook the sides while the machine works on the main course.. If you're new to pressure cooking, I'd recommend getting a cook book to go along with this. I purchased Bob Warden's Slow Food Fast - it's great but a bit simple. If you're looking for something slightly more intricate, I've heard good things about Miss Vickie's Big Book of Pressure Cooking (not sure if that's the exact title).. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend."},

I'm about 180s so I don't think I broke it, but its making it tough to track my actual weight gain and loss. Honestly, I got what I paid for so I am somewhat happy in that regard.

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Great Looks - Easy to Use - Accurate", "review_body": "Nice slim and lightweight design.  This complements my bathroom decor, though perhaps options for different colors or see-through might be a good ordering option.  Large and bright backlit display showing the numbers, easy to read - a real plus in either a lit or dark room as the numbers show up very well with the blue backlit display.. Simple setup, take out of the box insert the batteries, use. This is pretty much all the easy to read and fully illustrated user documentation that comes with it has as well - some suggestions for proper use and details on three error codes that could be displayed are in the instruction document as well.  One instruction says to be sure and install the batteries in the correct polarity direction and this is my one negative observation - the markings for which way the batteries go in are very small and on the edge / lip of the compartment, not on the bottom of each battery area.  I am talking REAL small indicators. The direction is not shown in the instruction diagram either.  For reference or those without really good eyes, and perhaps 'obvious' is the negative, or flat side of the battery goes against the spring..  If you want to change the reading to kilos, the button on the back (clearly marked) is pressed to change back and forth from Lbs. to Kilo - defaulted to Lbs. for me.. Although this is slim and lightweight it is not fragile, I had no fear of just stepping right up onto it.  I have read several reviews indicating inaccurate readings when used several times.  For me this has not occurred or been noticed, I stepped on, noted my weight (which matched my doctors office calibrated scale), stepped off and then my wife stepped on it, again the weight shown matched the calibrated scale at the doctors office.  A few hours later I stepped on the scale again, same weight as noted before."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "If you use it properly, this scale is 100% accurate.", "review_body": "I've been reading some of these other reviews and I suspect the users are not using the scale properly.  If you just stand on it and read the numbers, and then step off and zero it and step back on, it's quite likely you'll get slightly different weights.  The same thing happens with the 550 lb. medical quality digital scale in the office where I work.  On the other hand, if you stand on it and stay motionless for a few seconds until it stabilizes and the display begins to blink, you can step off and it retains the weight on the display, THAT is the correct, accurate weight.  If you zero it and repeat the process, you'll get exactly the same weight, time after time.  After reading some of these reviews I just did that, 5 times in a row, and got the same weight 5 times in a row, right down to the decimal place.. The scale looks modern and the lighted blue display is easy to read.  The price is right, what more could you want?  If you use it the way it was designed, on a hard surface like a tile bathroom floor, and if you give it time to stabilize and lock in the reading, you'll see that it's perfectly accurate."},

And for the everyday messes that my family makes, these Sparkle paper towels work just fine. Right before trying out Sparkle, I had been using a similarly-sized roll of Brawny.  I took a moment to do a couple of basic tests. To me, these towels are basically identical, except I will say that Brawny felt a little bit more substantial. I would never have noticed unless I was doing a side by side comparison, but I do believe that Brawny is the slightest bit thicker. That said, as far as cleaning up a test spill of water on the countertop, both performed comparably well.  No complaints at all.. I tried the \"Just White\" version, though Sparkle also comes in prints and colors for those who like their paper towels a bit fancier. I'm fine with \"just white,\" which, of course, still had the \"thirst pockets\" texture that I have come to expect from virtually all brands of paper towels.  The box I received contained a total of twenty-four \"Giant+\" rolls, each providing a total of 107 two-ply sheets. These twenty-four rolls came in twin packs, nicely packaged in a box within a box. None of the rolls were crushed or affected in any way, which is great considering how large the box was that arrived on my doorstep.. I am not entirely sure what constitutes \"Giant+,\" but these measured up to my Brawny XL, which is also helpfully pick-a-size.  Most importantly, despite being \"giant,\" this roll fit with no problem at all on my old wooden rack under the counter, which sometimes has trouble with the super-mega-huge rolls.  I guess \"giant\" is big but not too big, at least for us.  All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend the Sparkle brand. While on an incredibly nitpicky scale I would say that Brawny has a slight advantage based on my unscientific comparison, both performed equally well when it really mattered.  Recommended."},

They did not do a very good job protecting my hands from cleaning chemicals.  They were not very absorbent in spills. They were mostly useful as dinner napkins, but I am not likely to keep two rolls of paper towels on the counter for one general use.. Using paper towels for most cleaning uses around my house tends to protect me from flus and other uncouth diseases that come home from schools.  I am a long time fan of Bounty paper towels.  I especially like the select-a-size rolls and will always bring those home, or rather order them.  But we go through a lot of paper towels, maybe a case of 18 or 24 a month.  I have always preferred paper towels for most cleaning jobs and general uses around the house, especially the emergency sneezing attack cloth.  The cost gets pretty high.  But it pays off in the hygienic sense.. I had looked at these a few times in the store and considered them.  Maybe as dinner napkins (because we are napkin heathens most of the time), maybe for floor spills.  How could the paper towel matter with with of those uses?  A lot of paper towels get wasted.  It turns out that the napkin is fine, though e.v.e.r.y. single person at the table noticed it and m.e.n.t.i.o.n.e.d. it.  LOL.  But for the floor or spill use, these are not at all useful.  By time you get enough of them on the spill, half the roll is gone.. These were not really good for cleaning for me.  I use Lysol and spray bleach cleaners and like to not have to worry about my hands.  This paper towel just didn't cut it for cleaning either."},

They are 2-ply, embossed with a circular motif that adds to their ability to absorb and stay durable, and solid white. Each sheet is right at 7 inches long which allows one to tear off whoever much they think they will need without much waste.. They aren't particularly soft when dry, but they soften up a bit when wet. That bit of rough texture makes them clean a counter or stovetop well, but other brands, like Viva, are better should you have to quickly stop some bleeding, dry some tears or wipe a little face.. The rolls are fairly big - I don't know that I would call them giant but they are about as big as will fit on some paper towel holders that are close to a One roll is enough for my 3 person family but use can really vary by what you do with them. I drain foods, clean up anything yucky, clean my fridge, occasionally dry a glass or a dish, and occasionally grab one for a napkin.. This comes as a big box that is very heavy.  It was too heavy for me, I had to have help with it.  The GP box is appropriate for storage, or you can take individual packs out to store.  (The GP container IS very thin corrugated cardboard that's against some regulations though.)  It has individually wrapped packs of 2 inside."},

We order as much as possible using Amazon\u2019s Subscribe and Save service. The paper towels we\u2019ve been ordering are thicker and feel softer, but I realize that they don\u2019t necessarily absorb more than these Sparkle Paper Towels. The only real difference that I\u2019ve been able to ascertain is when it comes to heavy scrubbing. The Sparkle towel breaks up sooner. However, since we\u2019ve been attempting to behave in a more conscientious manner, more \u201cgreen,\u201d we\u2019ve been using less paper products overall. For anything that requires scrubbing, we try to grab one of the many stashed dishcloths bought just for that purpose. For us, it\u2019s a plus that these Sparkle towels don\u2019t stand up as well as more expensive paper towels. It can only help reinforce getting into the more eco-friendly dishcloth habit.

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Very absorbent", "review_body": "For years I have bought the Bounty Big Rolls because I like their texture and I like the fact that they are so large and last longer. The only problem with them is that they don't fit well on a paper towel holder that mounts sideways on a counter - they're best on the standalone holders where you just slip them on top of the vertical bar.. These towels don't have that problem; they are also larger than the standard roll yet the still fit on the horizontal counter holders.. I also found them remarkably durable since I have usually found brands other than Bounty can tear apart easily or not absorb enough. That is not the issue with these.. The only reason for not getting 5 stars is that they are not quite as soft texture-wise as the Bounty. If that is something that matters to you, then take that into account."},

They do well when cleaning countertops, or even cleaning up a messy spill without falling apart like so many cheaper paper towels do.  The only complain I have with them is they are a bit on the rough side -- they aren't quite as soft as I have become used to with Bounty towels.. Another thing to note, they claim to be \"Giant Plus\" rolls, but I would call these a jumbo roll at best - again, I've seen the Bounty Giant Rolls and they have much more sheets on them than these do.  Though it seems everyone nowadays is playing pretty loose with the size moniker, so just be aware!. Overall, a good deal for towels that will get the job done - just a bit on the scratchy side!"},

We're lucky to live in a city that has excellent tap water, but it's those trace amounts of unseen things (chlorine, heavy metals, etc.) that can be worrisome. This Brita Longlast pitcher replacement filter is good for 120 gallons, which translates to six months of use for the average family. It blocks out 99 percent of lead and now even more contaminants such as cadmium, mercury, and other pollutants that seep into groundwater.. Those who have used these filters  know that they're easy to install and take out. This one has a \"pull top cap\" that makes it particularly simple to push in or pull out as needed. More technical aspects of the filter include \"activated carbon\" that reduces the taste and odor of chlorine; adsorbents to reduce lead; and a \"fibrous matrix\" that prevents those black flecks that can show up in some water filters. Interestingly, the filter keeps in some fluoride, which is known to promote healthy teeth. The unhealthy aspects of fluoride in water has been noted over the years.. Brita is conscious about the environment. The company's filters are BPA free and (unbeknown to me until now) offers a way to recycle its filters, which people can learn about at brita.com/recycling. As noted on the box, using just one of these filters can save 900 water bottles.. For the heck of it, me and another family member did a water taste test, drinking both tap water and water that was purified through a Brita filter. The filtered water had no taste that I could discern, whereas the tap water had a slight taste that was only noticeable after several swallows. I would think people who live in an area where the water is much worse than ours would really benefit from these filters.. Lastly, this filter came with three stickers that help users know when to change the filter via a reset button on the pitcher. Our pitcher doesn't have this feature, but I'm sure the stickers are useful to those who have one."},

I started cooking more lately and wanted to utilize this on most meals because it is supposed to make life simpler. That's when I notice the flaw and inconsistencies with the lid sealing. I cleaned the lid, the rubber seal; I boiled water to see if the stream would clean something out but to no avail, I can't get it to work properly.

There are so many safety features built into it  It isn't only a pressure cooker but it is a slow cooker, rice cooker, there is a bean setting, one for soup, one for meats, for poultry,  steamer, yogurt maker, porridge, multigrain,  etc.  It preserves and seals in the nutrients that you want to keep in your food.. Hands down....the greatest kitchen appliance ever!  I received this 2 days ago and cooked a stew from start to finish in under an hour, an almost 8 lb. turkey breast this morning in 1/2 hour and a full rack of meat falling off the bone ribs tonight in 30 minutes and also made my own turkey stock from the turkey this morning.  It is phenomenal!  It allows you to cook a healthy meal in a minimal amount of time.  Who would have thought turkey could cook in 1/2 hour?  You can even make cheesecakes in it that taste better than if you cooked them in the oven.  Want hard boiled eggs?  Put them in there and steam them.  Steamed vegetables take no time at all also.. It is a very sleek stainless steel design with black appliance with digital readings and buttons for all the functions.  The inner pot is stainless steel with a reinforced bottom that heats the food faster.  Cleanup is a breeze with the pot..

The vegetables were perfectly cooked. Cleanup was very easy. I dove right into a pork tenderloin. Using the saute feature I browned the pork and then 2 onions. Using the manual setting for 15 minutes, and then a 10 minute release and 5 minute rest, the pork was absolutely tender. Once of the tastiest tenderloins I have had. The cleanup was again very easy.

After our kid was done with diapers, someone stashed the Genie in our garage to use for our next kid. Well about 2 years later, the next kid arrives and we pull the Genie out of the garage to dust off and use again. Guess what we found?! We found old diapers in it - not infested with bugs, not stinking outside the bag at all, and the bag was intact. They were in there for years and nobody noticed! Of course when we cut the bag off to throw it out, we were hit with quite the stench but it was remarkably contained all that time. We were very impressed and grossed out at the same time."},

They\u2019re hard to see because they\u2019re virtually clear, but I pick them up as soon as I see them. The hazard is my infant finding one first and sticking it in her mouth. As you probably know, clingy plastic can easily block off a baby\u2019s windpipe, and it would be hard to figure out (in time) why the baby isn\u2019t breathing.

My twins will blast through this box in two months, and they're in day care for half the day.. I hate paying these inflated prices for what is essentially the roll of bags you get in the produce department for free.  But I'll stop using my Diaper Genie when you pry it from my cold dead hands.

Who wants to smell poopy diapers thrown in an inside trashcan or have to traipse up and down the stairs and walk them to the outside trashcan? Not me. That's where this little baby (no pun) comes in real handy. But alas, as many have stated before, the refills can become quite expensive real fast unless you use it correctly.. Bottom line (and only halfway through my rant, lol), only use it for the poopy diapers (aka #2). Why take up valuable space for just a pee (#1) diaper? Just throw the #1 diapers into whatever trash can you have nearby and take the garbage out as you normally would. In our case we have a small waste basket outside the little guy's room and once a day we empty it into the big trash can and take it outside to the even bigger trash can. And once a week and even bigger trash can (on wheels) comes and takes it to an even bigger trash can.. But for #2 diapers we use the Diaper Genie. Since he's a regular once a day kind of guy we don't usually have to empty the Genie but once a week. Which makes each refill last about 2 months and each 3-pack around 6 months. If you use it that way it isn't really much of a financial burden.. Now, someone else suggested, when the bag is full, cutting the bottom of the bag (where the knot is) and emptying the diapers into the trash can and then retying and reusing the genie bag over and over. To me that is just gross and possibly messy. I'm not that desperate and if you use it only for poopy diapers you should be fine."},

They are worth the extra for a couple of reasons: 1. the cheaper brands have thinner plastic so they smell worse 2. Not sure how to explain this exactly, but when I put a diaper in the cheaper liner, the liner would bunch up and have excess plastic go through the little hole in the Diaper Genie, meaning I was wasting a few inches every time I changed a diaper, so it really was not worth the cheaper price! Hope that helps you justify the additional cost!"},

It's better if we keep it all in a pail in our children's room, let it ferment a little. We want those babies to stack on top of each other until it hits capacity.

As we all know, a baby's 'aroma therapy' (lol) becomes a lot stronger as they progress to solid foods, and the Diaper Genie did a substandard job at containing the odor after my child turned six months. Another Amazon customer recommended using Glad Odor Shield bags in lieu of the refills, and it works PERFECTLY (and is a more cost-effective alternative). Save the plastic ring that comes with the refills, and wrap the top of the plastic bag around the ring (Start with the bag inside of the ring and wrap it around the perimeter). Then, pull the draw string and tie it in a bow underneath the refill ring. Next, push the bottom of the bag through the opening of the Diaper Genie (the same opening you use to place soiled diapers inside of the genie). Finally, place the ring and plastic bag in the Diaper Genie, and it is ready for use. My baby is a little stinker :-), and I can now open the Diaper Genie without  being hit by a wave of funk in my face. :-) I paid  approximately $11 for a box of 80 Glad Odor Shield kitchen bags on Amazon, so this method is also saving me a lot of money."},

I have purposely waiting 4 months before writing a review for this. I wanted to see if my love affair with the Instant Pot was just a fling or true love.  It's true love.  This might have single handedly saved my marriage. Ok, perhaps that is an exaggeration, but not far from it.. I work full time.  So does my husband. I get home first and generally cook dinner.  I eat primarly vegetarian - no RED MEAT ever.  My husband eats primarily CARNIVORE style.  Cooking two seperate things has been a real pain and challenge, PLUS I know very little about cooking meat.  The instant pot has changed all of that.  I can make something for him FAST and easy, and not have to worry about ruining it.. Let me say, read the manual.  And then read it again and then keep close by as a reference.  I use this thing at least twice a week.  I cook things in it that are so simple and easy and taste like you have been slaving away in the kitchen.  The lifesaving part is how fast it is.  Yes, it's faster than cooking on the stove for the most part, PLUS you don't have to keep tending to whatever you are cooking.  Put it in and go.. I was very hesitant to pay this much for a \"gadget\" that I wasn't too sure about, but I hit a home run on this one.  There are many recipes on pinterest for the instant pot, plus I have purchased some books off of Amazon for it.  Once you get the hang of using it (there is not much learning curve - just follow the directions and use some common sense) you can think of many things that you cook on the stove or the crockpot that you will now do in the Instant Pot.

This is a brilliant machine! When my slow cooker died a few months ago, I started the process of finding what I should replace it with. I'd heard of the Instant Pot on a blog and was intrigued by it enough to research some more. I had never used a pressure cooker and was concerned if I purchased the Instant Pot, I wouldn't use it for this. With such an expensive price tag it took me several weeks to decide to just go for it.. The functions I use the most are:. -pressure. -slow cook. -saut\u00e9. I love that I can save time and dishes by saut\u00e9ing in the Instant Pot before pressure cooking or slow cooking. There are 3 adjustable heat settings for this function. The Instant Pot has so many variable settings, I can run it for as little or long as I want. It will automatically switch to he warm function when it is done. This was important to me since my old slow cooker did this which saved many dinners.. I've tried the pressure cooking portion of the Instant Pot several times now. At first I was terrified I would explode it. It's obviously not going to happen. There is a pressure release valve making it extremely safe in this mode. I've found that if I wanted to slow cook something and forgot to put it in, I can pressure cook it for a fraction of the time. It's been very experimental with this since the instruction books are very confusing on what to do with converting a slow cook recipe to pressure cook.. I've now been making bone broth several times a week on the pressure cook setting for 50 minutes with natural release. It's much more flavorful and is done in less than 1.5 hours compared to slow simmering for 8-10 hours. I've also made perfect hard boiled eggs, beef stew, braised beef and many other recipes. I'm a huge fan!. A couple downsides that I've found so far is that the shape of the pot is hard to put some roasts in it. The shape of the meat needs to be the opposite of the shape needed for a traditional slow cooker. The pot although dishwasher safe, does not come clean in the dishwasher. I've tried it many times and it's best to hand wash it. For broth and soups, the pressure cooker should never be filled more than 2/3 full. This means that the yield is much less than a traditional slow cooker or pot on the stove."},

It saves a lot of time because I can make rice or other recipes by loading up the stainless steel pot, hitting one or two buttons and walking away.  The pot does the rest, pressure cooking then holding the food hot until I'm ready to serve it (you can also specify that you want the food to cool down when you finish cooking).. It does a great job on rice and pretty much every recipe I've thrown at it... lentil curries and various soups.. This pot could save time for anyone, vegan or not.  Just take 10 minutes or so to prepare your recipe (usually just chopping stuff up), pop it in the pot, make one or two button selections (including cooking time) and your all set.. Apparently it also  a time delay feature which I've never used.. Pressure cooking is a very healthy way to prepare food, locking in flavor that might escape when cooking with a traditional pot.

One of my favorite things is that it is TRULY an all-in-one pot. I get frustrated with crockpot recipes that require searing meat in another pan or cooking meats through in another pan prior to putting them in the crockpot. Who wants any more dishes to wash? With this, I can sear the meat first, then incorporate the meat and vegetables and liquid and let it do the rest all in one container. No oil splattering out of the skillet if the meat flops over while trying to sear it because the sides are high enough to prevent both the splattering or the flopping over. It cooks good sized pieces of roast. I even made mashed potatoes with no extra liquid to be poured out in a little over 10 minutes once the cut pieces were in the pot - 20 minutes tops. It usually takes 20 minutes for the potatoes in a stock pot once the water comes to a boil, then add the ingredients. No strainer required. One less dish to wash and the stovetop was free for preparing other items. I highly recommend this to any family needing a new crockpot and for newlyweds."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "This is NOT Your Grandma\u2019s Pressure Cooker", "review_body": "Although I\u2019ve only had my IP for a few days, I am beyond pleased with its performance. It\u2019s larger than it looks, so it will take up some counter space. Also, keep in mind these new appliances have shorter cords. Ideally, you should use it away from your cabinets due to the amount of steam they produce.. Most of the functions you\u2019ll use WON\u2019T be in the quick program buttons. The majority of users find it more practical to use the Pressure Cook (also referred to as manual) feature and set the time. Recipes generally don\u2019t include the time it takes for the IP to get hot or build up pressure, and many don\u2019t tell you how long it takes for full depressurization (when you can actually open the lid). It will depend on the quantity of food and liquid, as well as temperature, time, and pressure settings. You\u2019ll get used to it. I cooked a 3-lb pork loin roast from start to finish in an hour and a half. It took about 10 minutes to get up to pressure, an hour to cook, and 20 minutes to release the pressure.. Speaking of pressure, there\u2019s a knob on top of the lid that you turn to either vent or seal. This allows you to do what\u2019s called a Quick Pressure Release. It\u2019s fast, a bit loud, and steamy \u2014  so be careful. This is a normal and frequently used feature, as some foods need to get out of the heat quickly. Other recipes, such as whole cuts of meat, generally allow time for what\u2019s called a Natural Pressure Release (where the pot slowly releases pressure on it\u2019s own). This is like the pressure cookers of the older generation. You just wait until the pressure pin drops and open the lid, being careful to tip it away from you.. There is a bit of a learning curve for the first few uses of any electric pressure cooker, so have some patience. I find the Facebook group \u201cInstant Pot Community\u201d to be extremely helpful.. This isn\u2019t your grandma\u2019s old pressure cooker. It\u2019s smart, safe, and versatile. You can saut\u00e9 your veggies in a little oil, throw in the meat, and reset the pot to pressure cook... resulting in a tasty meal in under an hour. AND, once it\u2019s done cooking, it will keep your food warm for up to 10 hours. There is a delay feature, too. You can buy a variety of accessories to stack and cook different items in their own containers, or make egg bites, hard boiled eggs, cheesecakes, lasagna, and much more.. The recipe book that comes with the pot is minimal \u2014 just a teaser compared to what\u2019s available online and in Facebook groups.. The power cord detaches from the base, so make sure it\u2019s firmly plugged in when you start cooking. The silicone gasket on the lid will pick up odors, and many people buy extras to use with their different foods (savory or sweet).

The nice feature of this scale that scales I've seen sold locally do not have, is the lighted background to make it easier to read.

I have not counted diapers so see if I can get 245 diapers w/in one container but it seems to fill up very quickly, not reaching 245; and I do wrap the diaper tight before throwing away.  The other not so convenient thing is you have to make the bag; meaning, you tie the knot at the end pull it to the bottom of the container.

So I have a snake of diaper pouring out the top of the genie - not very nice looking..   2.  Difficult to explain, but there is a plastic horizontal \"guard\" that you pull the diaper bag around (it's left behind when you peel away the tab to open the refill).

That mattress pad ended up leaking and we did end up having to have our mattress replaced under warranty. I decided to look on Amazon for other mattress pad reviews to see if it made sense to purchase a different type of mattress pad. I picked this one due to it saying it was good with foam memory mattresses and it also had good reviews about it's waterproof capability etc. My husband and I spent a lot of money on this mattress and I think this is the first time we have actually been able to enjoy the comfort. We hadn't realized before that the mattress pad we were using was inhibiting the memory foam. I finally feel like my body is sinking into the mattress the way it is supposed to. I don't think we will go back to the very expensive mattress pad again even though this mattress pad may not protect our mattress with warranty what's the point of having an expensive mattress if you can't enjoy it?

However, I love the Instant Pot so much I had to take the time to write this review.I had a stove top pressure cooker but I was always so scared of it that I ended up giving it away.  I have had the Instant Pot for about a month now and it has quickly become a staple in my kitchen. It has saved us money, actually, as all those times when my husband would say \"Oh, let's just order out\", I have been able to whip up a quick meal in the Instant Pot. I love that I can saute ingredients directly in the pot and then add the remaining ingredients and either pressure cook or slow cook depending on my schedule for the day (spaghetti sauce is slow cooking in the Pot as I write this). The Pot takes steel cut oats to a whole new level. I make a batch about twice a week and my hubby, who absolutely loathes oatmeal, happily devours this for breakfast. Yesterday, I made broccoli cheese soup--yum!. I have not tried the yogurt maker yet, but I am excited about that as I have two Dalton type yogurt makers with the individual cups. I rather prefer the idea of making one big batch in the Instant Pot. I also have heard that risotto is very good (and way less time consuming) made in the Instant Pot, so that is also on my list of things to try. I like the fact that the inner pot is stainless steel--I am not a big fan of the non stick stuff. I do wish that the see-through lid that is used for slow cooking was included, but, oh well, I needed it, so I bought it anyway. The Pot does take up a significant amount of counter space (for me, anyway, as my counter space is limited.) but I tend to leave it out on the counter, anyway, as I use it so often!

I've used stove top models for the past 25 years and I've always felt like they were adequate and it was not necessary to buy of these new-fangled multi-function showboats!  However I purchased the Instant Pot in the 6-qt model for a friend of mine, who doesn't do a lot of cooking and is a very busy working mother of two busy kids. I thought that this would help her to prepare quick, nutritious, easy meals for her family. When I got a good look at it, I decided to purchase the 8-quart model for myself to give it a go. I cannot tell you how happy I am that I broke down and bought it. This appliance is so much simpler to use. I can actually drink my wine while preparing my meals when using this. No more intense thinking about the best method for each entree or remembering to set timers (how long has it been at full pressure????), which is good for this middle-aged woman who has a healthy red wine habit and advanced multiple sclerosis (memory is not my forte).  I have made numerous dishes, mostly utilizing the PC function, combined with the saute function beforehand.  The greatest thing about this PC/multi-function appliance is how simplistic it is when compared to its (ancient) cousin, the stovetop pressure cooker.  Despite telling myself for years that my stovetop PCs (I have 3 of them) could do everything that the new electric models could do, it takes much more effort and there is a steeper learning curve. After using them for years, there was still the occasional scorched ingredients in the bottom of the cooker.  No more.  Yes, I know, you can use the PIP method. But that significantly decreases the capacity of your PC. You have to find a heatproof bowl/ casserole dish that fits into the PC and still holds a decent amount of food. I've made curries, pulled pork, numerous breakfast recipes, and all have turned out fantastic.  My stovetop models are still useful but this is my go-to cooker.  I can use the stovetop models I have to \"bake\" potatoes, quick steam veggies, hard boil eggs, etc while main dishes are cooking in the new Instant Pot.  Other advantages:. 1.  You only need a power supply to use it.  If you have a huge group at your home, it can go in the next room (in my case, the laundry room) and free up my cooktop and counter space.. 2.  It is silent.. 3.  There is NEVER anything scorched on the bottom.  The only time I use the PIP method is when I am putting something in ramekins or dessert pans such as springform pans, etc.. 4.  Non-PC users are no longer terrified in my kitchen.  I am sold!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Eggs, yogurt, and last minute dinners. Oh my!", "review_body": "I hemmed and hawed about getting yet another kitchen gadget (I already own a steamer - albeit on its last legs, a bread maker, and three slow cookers), but I do weekly meal prep and was looking for something to make large volume cooking a bit easier and more efficient.. I'm so glad I bought the instant pot, and it has come in even more handy than I imagined it would. In particular, I'm a huge fan of doing hard cooked eggs in it for a number of reasons. First, I live in a drought-prone area and I love that it uses SO much less water than boiling. Second, the eggs come out cooked to perfection every time. Third, they peel like a dream.. I've also used it to heat up soup from frozen in about 20 minutes, make crack-free cheesecake, cook tough items like barley and dry beans, and homemade yogurt. I've been making my own yogurt for several years now and my old method was fairly straightforward but time intensive. I used to heat up mason jars full of milk in the microwave (took about 20 minutes with constant stirring and checking temperature), let it cool to 110F, inoculate with starter, and incubate in the oven with the light on for 8 or so hours. However, this process rendered my oven unusable for the better part of a day which is problematic while doing meal prep! Now, I put the jars of milk in the instant pot, steam for 1 minute to scald, allow to cool, and use the yogurt function to incubate at the correct temperature for 8 hours.. I feel like I still have so much to explore with the instant pot, but I'm already in love. Of course, I'm sure similar results can be obtained using a traditional stovetop pressure cooker, but I'm pleased with the set and forget aspect and the ability to free up space on my normally crowded stovetop.. Overall, this was worth every penny of the $100 I spent on it. I hope it lasts me a very long time!"},

Dry beans cooked in an hour, start to finish! Boiled cabbage is 15 minutes, start to finish without stinking up the house. A fully cooked chicken now takes about an hour start to finish, and we have sandwiches all week! Boston butt roast for pulled pork also cooks in less than an hour. I love that it also cooks frozen meats quickly, in case you forget to set it out to thaw. Rice is perfect and fluffy, and no boil-overs. Perfect boiled eggs, meatloaf, and more.

The first thing I made was an entire chicken in 20 minutes, which was fall of the bone tender. Next I made hard boiled eggs, which peeled easier than any other hard boiled eggs I've ever made. Since then, I have made over 50 meals in this pot, and it works perfectly every single time.. The pot is built to last, and it is very heavy duty. The buttons are very self explanatory but I would recommend looking up recipes online to figure out how to use the built in functions to their maximum abilities.. I would recommend buying an extra inner pot because it is a hassle to cook a main dish and then clean the pot and then cook the side dish and I would also recommend buying an extra silicone sealing ring because it catches smells easily and it can make lighter foods such as yogurt smell funny..

There is a learning curve to using this pressure cooker, but it is well worth it!!  Being able to cook foods even from frozen is a huge time saver, since I can still prepare meat even if I forget to thaw it out.  And having foods come out tender after only 20-30 minutes cook time is amazing.  I can cook the main dish in the pressure cooker, and I don't have to tend to it all all while I prepare side dishes or a salad or sauce, etc.  There are tons of recipes on the internet although a cook book is also a good idea for beginners.. The pressure cooker yields the same results as a crockpot on say, a tough cut of meat, cooking it into a tender delicious meat, but in a fraction of the time.  Sometimes I just don't plan ahead, but I can still cook meat even from frozen, and it comes out great.  I can start it cooking, and then kind of \"set it and forget it\" while I tend to side dishes.  I don't have to keep an eye on it, or stir it.. Also, I found with some crock pot recipes, with ingredients like fruits or some of the chinese food recipes, they tended to kind of melt together and lose flavor if I started them before work and then came home for dinner.  That doesn't happen with the instant pot.  Less cooking time, so flavor stays fresher.  Chicken breast can dry out in a slow cooker, it doesn't happen with an instant pot.. It really does replace numerous appliances, it can be used as a rice cooker also, and can still function as a slow cooker.  It really does live up to the hype!. Also - the saute function is the bomb!  With a crockpot, if you want to brown the meat first, or cook bacon, it requires another pan.  With the instant pot, you get to literally do it all in one pot.  Plus you have the browning from the sauteing that adds another level of flavor.. Another thing is, I really think that with the pressure, the foods absorb more of the seasonings.  I have found foods just come out tasting better.  I made a Ropa Vieja that was just delicious, even though it was the same recipe I've used before.. I've used it to \"bake\" sweet potatoes, which took a lot less time than the oven, so dinner took a lot less time to prepare, and I didn't heat up the whole kitchen, another big plus.  While it is really \"steaming\" them (the skins are wet, not dry and crispy like they are in the oven), it really seemed to have more flavor!  My daughter was scraping the last of the sweet potato off the skins, when she usually just eats the middle and leaves a lot of sweet potato still attached to the skins.. I've only had mine for a couple of weeks, but I'm already a huge fan.  The IP has all the benefits of slow cooking, but so many more options!!"},

It cooked an whole chicken in 30 minutes...and it was tender and juicy.  I will say that I seem to be sacrificing a little bit of flavor with the pressure cooker setting.  Probably because it's not stewing in the spices for hours.  I think maybe using a marinade and letting it sit for the day would help.  Still worth every penny.. The 8 qt size is HUGE, so make sure you have space for it.  I thought I did and was wrong.  I had to store it without the top on, and shuffle several things around.. My absolute favorite thing about this product is that I can brown my meat before I start the slow cooker or pressure cooker cycle.  I browned a brisket, put in some broth and seasoning, pressure cooked for 50 minutes, then took out the brisket and set it to saut\u00e9 to make the gravy.  All in one pot.  Awesome."},

So for a small experiment, i stood again on the scale only to see that it should 3 pounds less. i and my husband repeated the same for almost 10 times with considerable gap and it never once showed one constant value. A week before i used my sister in law had checked hers, it showed 154 lbs for my sister in law, who is actually 145lbs, we went into believing (since she is a foodie) and my husband gave his upset sister a lecture on how to lose weight. LOL!. My bad, i lost the guarantee card which i did not even fill."},

Now, it weighs me drastically different weights if I step on then step off then step back on again, or if I weigh myself on one part of the floor then move it even a few feet over. I'm trashing this one and buying a more reliable brand.. But hey, if you need a scale that'll work for only a year and is pretty cheap, go for this one."},

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Does its job, but needs slight improvement", "review_body": "I buy these refills for our\u00a0. . They fit in the pail well and do what they are designed to do. My only suggestion for improvement would be to have the end of the bags be connected to the plastic ring somehow. I dislike when I get towards the end of the pack and I throw a diaper in and the whole bag falls into the pail. I feel so wasteful having to cut the life of a bag short because it won't stay in the ring. Sometimes I'll cut off the filled portion and the remaining bag isn't quite long enough and I end up pulling the whole rest of it out. If it was glued in there somehow, then I could use up every last inch of the bags without wasting any.. One tip I've seen people mention that I am going to reiterate is how to get more out of your bags. When it's time to empty, I push down whatever diapers are in the pail and squeeze out the extra air. I keep doing this until I have a compact air-free package of dirty diapers and then I cut the whole load off and tie it up. This will save you a lot of bag length. Try it next time and check out the difference between where you would have had to cut before and where you ended up cutting after pushing the air out. This technique will prolong the bags."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "It keeps the poop smell in with less waste than the off-brand competition", "review_body": "These refills work to keep the poop smell in, and I guess that's pretty much all I'm looking for here. With one exception, which is why I've only give 4 stars. They really should somehow let you know when you're almost out of bag so you can continue to use the end vs being left with too little bag to use and having no choice but to waste it. I will say, though, that this is far superior to the cheaper off-brand version also sold on Amazon. The design for the off-brand bags allowed more bag to come out with each diaper inserted, resulting in SO much waste. The Playtex refills let you really stuff the diapers in, so you're wasting as little as possible."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Good product but a little expensive.", "review_body": "This product works great with our Diaper Genie 01210 Essentials Diaper Disposal System. It is easy to refill. It's nice that you can just tie off the end whenever you are ready to take out the trash. We have one child; he is 6 weeks old and goes through 8-10 diapers a day. One of these refills lasts us about 10 days (meaning the pack of 3 is about a one month supply). I have no complaints about the product itself or the functionality; however, I do think it is a little expensive. $19 a month seems crazy to spend on just the plastic bags I throw diapers in. I will be looking for a cheaper alternative, but like I said I am happy with the product itself."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Gambling Is Fun!", "review_body": "The generic ones are terrible.

I've had an issue twice with trying to figure out where the bag begins when I've opened a new container, but was able to tuck the extra plastic back in without an issue.

The problem lies with the bags being to narrow so you have to keep reloading and pulling the extra bag down every time the pale gets full. It's a pain however it's worth it to not smell dirty diapers in your room/house. For a brief week we used a closed lid garbage can and it made the entire room smell the seal is just not the same as the diaper genie. Would highly recommend the diaper genie.

This has made it possible for me to make delicious, full meals that taste amazing and only spend a short amount of prep time on. The meat turns out so amazing and falls apart!

I have a couple of small metal bowls that I use for cooking smaller quantities of rice & oatmeal.  I love that I don't have to babysit it like I do if I'm trying to make oatmeal on the stove. I cooked a whole butternut squash in it the other day and that was amazing.  I've also cooked one pot pasta which was great.

Nope. Steamed bread? Yep! Steamed/boiled potatoes? Yep!  But, not what I hoped for.. AND forget the word instant and ignore the ridiculous cook times. The one cup minimum of liquid needs to come to a boil and release enough steam to pressurize the unit BEFORE the cook time starts. Afterwards meats and most other meals need 10-15 minutes of Natural Pressure Release before you can open the pot.. I still rate it 5 stars because it does what it does so well. I'm still glad I purchased it.. Tip: Don't buy a glass lid until you check what you already own.. Get recipes from proven sites, not random Pinterest posts or blogs. Good ones include; Amy and Jackie, Hip Pressure Cooking,  Pressure Luck, Frieda Loves Bread."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Perfect whole grain rice and lot's more", "review_body": "I wasn't sure if I'd like this Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 or not. But, it is easy to use and I liked all the safety features and the larger size will make it more versatile than the smaller size. I grew up with my mother using a pressure cooker but I never really adopted using it as an adult but lately have decided to change that. The unit arrived quickly and was in good condition. It arrived in a cardboard box within the product box. The Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-in-1 unit has a lot of nice features including ability for making yogurt and rice. After doing the initial test run I decided to try cooking whole grain rice. The included recipe booklet has both English and Chinese language broken up into 2 different sections. Interestingly, the pictures in the Chinese section was much bigger than in the English section. Anyways, I followed the whole grain rice English recipe which uses the manual mode and not the rice mode. I couldn't believe it - in about 30 minutes the whole grain rice came out perfect-the best I've ever had! I noticed that the unit came up to pressure very fast - faster than I can do on the stove with my traditional pressure cooker. It also didn't produce any steam or overflow liquid (like I've seen happen in my Cuisinart rice cooker which produced a horrible mess). It's handy that it has a little overflow container should any liquid come out. I also made vegetable soup which came out great. I do pay attention to the maximum fill line. It's so nice that once it's set you can leave it to it and don't have to watch over it. Nice feeling of freedom."},

You need to re-learn all your recipes all over again (mostly by trial and error) or you will get a watery mess. I like that you can just forget about it after you start it, and things stay warm until you decide to return. I have an old slow cooker,  now collecting dust and taking up space. After the Instantpot honeymoon, I tried to store it away too, but it's so big (6qt) I could not find any shelf tall enough! Its forgotten once you move it down stairs -- maybe bring it up for the winter soups and stews. (see photo - 12 inches high with lid inverted.)"},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Not a Slow-Cooker", "review_body": "The biggest problem with this appliance is the slow-cooker function, which simply doesn't get hot enough. I was hoping I could get rid of my old slow-cooker and replace it with this, but I've found that even on high, the Instant Pot can't maintain already bubbling food at a simmer and doesn't work at all to cook meat, beans, or soup over an extended period. It's frustrating, because if the slow cooker temperature were about ten degrees hotter, the Instant Pot would be close to perfect. I love that I can use Saute to brown meat, then use the pressure cooker function to cook it into pot roast, all in the one pot with easy clean-up. Although I know other people swear by it as a rice cooker, I find it's just about as fast and easy to make rice on the stovetop, but for cooking beans, it's an absolute winner. All in all, its low slow-cooking temperature really limits its usefulness, but it's still worth having as a pressure cooker."},

So I calmed down, set the whole unit aside and opened another refill a week later.  Similar problem, but this time only an inch or so was welded to the shell and I was eventually able to pull it loose.  I then was able to use the refill.  Playtex has a quality problem.  I am sure that it is difficult to inspect for a bad weld, but I would buy someone else's product until they get it solved.

The waterproof top (which is not noisy at all and has a soft top with waterproof backing, I believe) covers the entire top surface area well and the fitted sheet sides extend pretty far past our regular fitted sheet. It stays put well, even over the mattress protector bag that the mattress came with. It does not seem to interfere with the beds temperature at all- I tend to feel too hot at night and haven't had that issue with this bed and mattress cover despite the hot weather we've had lately.. Fortunately for me (but unfortunately for the review) the cover has not yet been put to the waterproof test. It seems that it will hold up well to at least a moderate amount of liquid. And I don't believe that the sides not being waterproof would be an issue for the average person. It seems to offer adequate protection for most uses, and perhaps helps with proper ventilation of the mattress by not wrapping the entire thing in a waterproof bag."},

I almost looked as if the unit had been used before, the packing was sloppy too.  Luckily Amazon has an awesome return service!  I was very surprised by the poor quality of what came after having got the first one which was perfect.  I hope the replacement is better, otherwise I'm going elsewhere!"},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Product Good, problem handling:not so much!", "review_body": "When it was working, this pressure cooker was easy to use. I used it, at least, 3 times per week. I purchased it dec. 1, 2015 and sadly 2 days ago it just stopped working.(noPr) I followed the troubleshooting tips, nothing, i put in a work ticket per instructions. I quickly received a reply with a list of 8 steps to a \"simple\" test. The 1st item was to check the same items i told them i already did. Yes, the test was simple but the watching the time and logging what was happening for 30 mins was a bit much. You were also told to make of video of this happening with pictures of the lid showing the sealing ring(which i replaced by the way) and a picture of the silver label on the back of the pot along with the copy of your purchase invoice. So, no, i have never made a video of anything and at 63 years old i don't feel the need to start now! I will be replacing my pressure cooker, as soon as i can, but not with this brand! It's too bad that their customer service procedure was not as good as their pressure cooker!"},

I used to own a seperate crock pot and pressure cooker; the PC was the type that needed babysitting. I saw this 3qt model and took a risk. It's much easier to use than I initially thought; the the buttons make using it as simple as using a microwave.. I like the stainless steel pot and trivet, and cooking one pot is something I'm already used to . I don't slow-cook as much as pressure cook, but this unit might change that. Like the seperate  rice and steamer settings, too; cooking rice has always been difficult, and I've developed a fondness for wild rice I can now indulge.. Will be donating the old pressure cooker and crock pot to Habitat for Humanity's ReStore; I think this little unit is a keeper"},

It is much easier to program and clean. If you put your food in hot it comes to pressure very quickly and uses little energy to maintain the setting. My wife let me be the first to use it.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Love these! Hate the color yellow!", "review_body": "This is my first foray into the world of microfiber cleaning cloths. I would probably try to find a softer version for cleaning delicate electronics, but these work great for scrubbing household surfaces.. They do a great job--I use homemade cleaning spray (dish soap, orange oil, water) on counters, and just the wet cloths on sink faucets, mirrors, shower tiles, and everything else. They shine up my chrome faucet and stainless sink with almost no effort. The three colors allow me to designate cloths for the kitchen/bath/remainder of the house--since I wash them all together, I shouldn't care, but it is nice to know your kitchen counter cloth didn't scrub your shower scum. I draw the line at toilets, but I use them for pretty much everything else. They even got the stickiness off the buttons on the back of the stove. I had tried various cleaners, magic erasers, nothing worked until this. Now we finally have non-gross oven buttons! They have not managed to degrease the wall behind the stove, however, but I'm not sure anything will. (Previous owners clearly loved cooking meat and were not so fond of cleaning walls. Eventually a backsplash will probably be the only solution.). They haven't impressed me with their absorbency, but we have a stack of cotton prefold diapers for spills, and I doubt much will compete with those.. I generally wash and dry the cloths on normal cycles, though dryers are not recommended. They do cling to the other laundry and attract small bits of lint, but I'd rather deal with that then hanging them all to dry individually.. My only gripe is the yellow color. Blue and white are great colors for cleaning, but the yellow just makes me think of pee and cheese (not necessarily at the same time.) I assigned the yellows to the kitchen, hoping the cheese association would win out, but pretty much any other color would be preferable. Even pink. But aside from my personal issues with the color yellow, they work great!"},

After putting a couple of diapers in the pail, the pail began to stink so bad we had to empty it out much faster than the playtex. Will be sticking with playtex from now on. 3 packs of 270 for the price of $16.87 is a pretty good price. I've looked around at target, heb, Wal-Mart and other places and found a 2 pack of 160 for the price of $14 something. So this is the cheapest, and I will continue to buy from Amazon."},

I gave it 4 out of 5 stars for only 1 reason.  Always in the course of changing a poopy diaper and the black stripe appears on the plastic refill bag to tell me its nearing the end of the refill, i drop the diaper in, and the bag falls out of the refill holder and lands in the bottom of the genie, and its always with a poopy diaper.  There is no last minute catch to keep it from happening.  But i assure, you'll have a heck of a time getting the refill started."},

The only way to keep the smell of dirty diapers out of your nursery is to dispose of them outside of your nursery. Since we bought one, we are in till them end.

I was so satisfied that I got an additional one in a Queen size to put on the couch under our couch cover.  With all the family and dogs on the couch it keeps the couch itself dry and odor free!  No one can tell there is an added protector under the Couch Cover when they sit on the couch- doesn't make the Crinkle noise that other protectors usually make and actually adds another layer of cushion.

My 2 year old son quickly put it to the test just several days after I'd put it on his mattress! It kept the mattress dry and there were no problems washing and drying it.

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "GOING DOWN!", "review_body": "Sparkle used to be one of the best paper towels on the market [my family purchased them for years, comparable in higher quality to Brawny]. and were priced reasonably.  Sparkle PTs went downhill once within the last few years as far as quality & value go, due to cheapening their product.  On my most recent order (late 4/2018), they changed the packaging label and very importantly they may have cheapened their product again.. I had three 2-roll big packages of the old Sparkle paper towels left from my last order, and received twelve 2-roll packages of the new & deliberately deteriorated version (same 107 2-ply sheets per roll and same 114.4 square feet area per package).  I have three observations after comparing the old higher-quality Sparkle paper towel rolls with the new cheapened product.  The new, lower quality Sparkle rolls are slightly lighter (less mass), contain thinner sheets (when held up to light), and are notably less dense & easier to squeeze vs. the old, better quality Sparkle paper towels.. I don't know why companies cheapen their product (redoing production lines & packaging designs costs big money, which they would be better putting into their product's quality) and it disgusts me when this happens.  I am sorry to say that Sparkle paper towels no longer sparkle in my opinon, after a double deliberate product decline [which benefits who?] from Georgia Pacific.  Note that Georgia Pacific makes both Brawny (hopefully still a fine-quality paper towel) and Sparkle paper towels (not so great any more), while Procter & Gamble makes Bounty -- which I don't understand why anyone would want to buy because they are not very strong or absorbent.  It might have been a highly educated business person who had this bright idea to cut cost by cutting quality . . . which may result in cut sales.  I would welcome a response from Georgia Pacific."},

A few weeks ago, my wife had one blow up on her and I decided to look into electric pressure cookers, finally deciding to buy the Instant Pot following the advice on this site and others.. It has been but a week but I am so impressed with it that I have to let everyone know.. Great things about the Instant Pot:. - It is easy to clean. And it is very light (the part that you have to clean, that is). Regular pressure cookers are monstrosities that have to be lifted with two hands and what not to clean.. - It is safe. Since the power is in control of the pot, there is no possibility that the pressure will rise to unsafe levels.. - You can set the time and forget it: you don't have to hover around or reduce the heat after the desired pressure is reached.. - There are lots of videos online.. -  It is ridiculous how simple cooking becomes with Instant Pot.. - It looks great on the counter.. - Everything that food touches is stainless steel.. - Interface is very simple.. - You can release the pressure fast if you want: just place a wet towel on top of the steam release gizmo and release the steam."},

I even poured water in without the inner pot. (Don;t recommend) This was about a couple days after I got it and thought I ruined it. I thought the inner pot was in and wasn't paying attention. I unplugged it. Dumped any residual water out. Unscrewed the bottom and dried it out with a hair dryer. Most of the water went straight through the bottom. Being impatient I did not let it dry out for a couple days. I was back in business about a half hour later after blow drying it out thoroughly. Food comes out great. Made some stuffed peppers in 3 minutes with some leftover taco meat from the night before. Put some cheese on, put lid back on to let it melt and they came out awesome! Added some sour cream and we were eating good. I mostly cook and my wife loves everything that comes out of our Instant Pot. Would recommend. Tons of recipes and accessories but you probably already know about that. It does take noticeably longer to heat up than our other 6 qt pressure cooker but that is to be expected. I bought this one because of the reviews and the stainless inner pot. Transitioning from non stick. Now all we use is stainless and cast iron. Definitely recommend this pressure cooker. I was worried after reading many reviews and they received dented models. Ours came without a blemish and we are extremely happy. It has earned a place on our counter."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "The more I use this thing the more I find to like about it.", "review_body": "I must say I read with some skepticism all the breathless reviews on this thing. It may be relevant also to mention that I stumbled across this unit as I was searching for something simpler: a plain old crock pot. I'd never had one of those before but as a recent re-entrant into the ranks of bachelorhood I really needed a way to be able to cook long cook-time things (mainly stews, soups) without it taking my attention the entire time. I opted for this unit thinking that even if I only use it as a crock pot, the programming capabilities are quite bit more sophisticated than what any of the crock pots I found were offering. But in the shot time I've had it I've used it in a number of different ways besides just the crock pot feature. This unit is quite versatile. I've only used the pressure cooking feature a few times but I can say that parts works very nicely. As other reviewers have pointed out, the marketing team may have been heavily involved in crafting the claimed 70% time savings. It's a perfect marketing thing.. just enough truth to it to be confusing to the unsuspecting. Yes you probably save 70% of the actual cooking time this way, but by the time you add back in the time it takes to ramp up to pressure and the time it takes to ramp back down to ambient (less so when you do quick-release which is safe and simple) it's not quite in that range any more.. In the short time I've had this unit I have made more soups and better soups than ever before. All with very little effort. Beef stew is fantastic (I do think it's worth it to take the extra 10-15 minutes on the front end to saute the meat). The day I got it was a workday. I cam home from work and found it on the porch, and put it to use right away. After a long day at work I set the thing up to make a beef stew while I slept (in slow cooker mode). Woke up to a lovely stew the next morning, put some in the fridge for later and took some for lunch that day. Very good stew. Looking forward to experimenting with different seasonings for different versions of the stew, and to giving pot roast a try.. I do heartily recommend this unit. The only thing I could think of that I might ask for is to persuade the manufacturer to offer an earthenware version of the insert that the food cooks in. It comes with stainless, which seems to be of good quality and definitely does the job. Maybe the earthenware version wouldn't be up to the task of saute I don't know."},

I've cooked ragu, corned beef, chocolate molten lava cake, creme brulee,  Chinese red bean dessert, pinto and red kidney beans and more. It has cut cooking time by more than half if done on the stove or oven but it does take around 20 minutes to come to pressure. To help cut the warm up time, I boil water before I put it into the PC. I also used the Cosori PC and it's night and day compared to the Instant Pot. The Cosori is so aggravating to use. It has problems cooking from the off setting. If you want to cook again after you just finished you have to jump though hoops.  You have to pull the plug and wait for the electronics to reset and hope it will work and even then it would not come to pressure or takes forever to come back to pressure.  With the Instant Pot, if the food is not cooked enough for you, all you need to do is just program it to cook again and it will without any problem.  Don't skimp. Pay the extra cost. The Instant Pot is 100 times better than other brands especially the Cosori. Believe me, I've used two Cosori and both worked the same. It was not defective. It's just does not work well. Theres a reason why the Instant Pot is rated the best because it is. Just buy it and you want regret it."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "It does pretty much everything, very pleased!", "review_body": "I had this in my cart for over a year while I researched it, read reviews, talked with folks who had them. I finally took the plunge and I'm sad I missed out on a year of a great appliance.. One of the best features is when I do a roast. Let me preface with I do not like how a roast comes out in a crockpot. All meat done in a crockpot is done to death, soggy and shreds. I want a roast that is quick, gives me clean slices and this delivers. A great feature is before you cook your roast, you typically have to brown it on all sides in a pan on the stove. But with the instant pot you can brown in the pot itself, add onions cook them down a bit, deglaze then put your roast back in. Cook the designated time and follow the instructions for quick release or normal release (which is basically letting the meat rest in the pot while the pressure comes down as the heat is off so you don't lose all your juices and flavor) and you'll have a fantastic piece of meat.. Eggs - I live in a rural area and we are very water conservative. I always hate having to use so much water to hard boil eggs. I did a dozen eggs in 1 cup of water. Put them in, set it to low pressure for a time of 5 min and you have hard boiled eggs. And they peel wonderfully, even the very fresh eggs.. Yogurt - I've made my own yogurt for a couple of years now. Yes I'm a snob now. The yogurt comes out wonderful! The only thing I do not do is the initial heating of the milk. I do that in the microwave because you can get some scorching on the bottom and a skin on the top. So once I heat it I pour into the instant pot itself and place the inner pot into a bowl with ice to cool it down to 110 degrees, add my culture and put the pot back in and set the yogurt time for 11 hours. I do strain for about 30 min when done and it's perfect!. Chicken - I've done hot wings, chicken thighs (bone in) and chicken breasts. One thing consistent, the skin on the chicken never cooks up right to me. It's aways rubbery. On the wings I had to put the wings into the broiler to brown them up and crisp the skin. So I only do skinless chicken now.. Stock - Save those chicken bones and veggie pieces in your freezer as you prepare meals thru the month and then you can make a fast and very good stock.. Cook Delay Feature - This is great! I had a roast that I had marinating and as we all know, let your meat come up to room temp a bit before cooking. This roast needed to sit out about 45 min before cooking. So I put it in the pot with the whole red potatoes and set the delay. Worked like a charm. And I should touch on how quite the unit is. You'll hear a beep when it comes to pressure and starts the cooking process and a series of beeps when it's complete.. Do keep in mind it's a heavy heat appliance so some might not be able to run the microwave, the instant pot and have their fridge all going at once and not pop a fuse.. Would I buy this again - Yes. Would I recommend this product to friends and family - Yes.. If I could change one thing what would it be? - Have a cord lock on the back of the unit so if you move the instant pot while it's cooking the cord doesn't, A - short itself or B - pop out.. Edited - Forgot to add - be sure to download the InstantPot app. Some great ideas in there."},

As far as the scales are concerned, despite the fact that it reads way too high (haha) it works very well, is sleek and attractive, unlike me.

It's easy to figure out, and although seems intimidating at first it is well-made and will let you know if the top isn't on correctly or if there's some other issue with the pressure. Since it has a sautee and slow cook mode, it provides other options for cooking rather than just pressure cooking. I was happy this is a 2-1 in machine so I'm able to get rid of my slow cooker. Another feature that I really like is that once it shuts off, it will keep food warm for 10 hours so you can have food waiting on you when you wake up or get home from work if you set it beforehand.

It's okay, but I have had questions about several of the settings that I could not answer from the manual.  I have been able to answer my questions by experimenting, however.  I have noticed that after using it about 5 times, I have a couple of small pits on the inside of the stainless steel pot.  Hopefully, this is merely cosmetic and not a sign of a failing s.s. coating.. It makes cheerful noises.  At the moment, we are using it to sterilize baby bottles more often than we are for making meals. It's very convenient as a bottle sterilizer, but be aware that you may need to choose \"low pressure\" for the \"steam\" setting so that the temperature doesn't damage plastic bottles.  A web search reveals that a lot of people has discovered this use for the Instant Pot.  I suppose other items needing sterilization could be processed in this way.. Be aware that the plastic measuring cup that comes with it is designed for measuring rice and is coordinated with the markings on the side of the pot.  It is NOT a one-cup measure.  Apparently, this minor weirdness has to do with its origin as a rice cooker."},

I was afraid to try this thing... but after weeks of searching out recipes, I gave in. After 1 meal, I was obsessed... I tried my beef stew. It takes me 8 hours in the slow cooker. After 45 minutes, we were sitting down to a delicious meal! I wasn't sure how the meat would cook, but it was PERFECT!. We recently went through a 30 day diet... (not sure I'm allowed to say the name!) After searching the internet, I was able to make 30 compliant meals.... 22 of them were made with my Instant Pot! There's no way my slow cookers would have worked... most of the ingredients for those meals were purchased just a couple of hours before dinner!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "... using my Instant Pot for a week now and love it! After considering buying one for a year ...", "review_body": "I've been using my Instant Pot for a week now and love it! After considering buying one for a year and then deciding to take the plunge on Black Friday, I am not disappointed with my purchase. I read many of the reviews before deciding to buy and the reviews are very helpful. I had planned to buy the 6 quart but the 8 quart Duo was on sale on Black Friday so that's what I bought. I'm glad I have the bigger size. As the reviews say, the instant pot does not prepare the foods instantly but it's very quick compared to many other cooking methods. It takes 10-20 min for the pot to come to pressure before it starts cooking the food (depends on how much liquid the recipe calls for). Once the cooking starts, it's fast for most things (3-20 min for the items I've made so far). There are some recipes that take longer- all depends on what you're making. Two of my biggest takeaways are: 1) buy multiple sealing rings. The sealing rings will take on the smells of the spices you cook with. I have a sealing ring for savory items (recipes using cumin, chili powder, garlic, etc.), 'sweet' items (like applesauce), and one for Indian recipes (which would be savory but I decided to designate one specifically for that type of food). I just ordered 2 more rings because I want to have a separate ring for savory recipes that don't use the spices I listed (ex chicken soup and vegetables).  2) Join some sort of beginners group on social media. I've found this so helpful. People post the recipes they use as well as questions. I would highly recommend this product!"},

So far I have made brown rice, lime chicken, Cuban black beans - and for the first time ever in my life - yogurt, several cheesecakes & lemon curd.  The buttons are easy to use and the instruction manual is easy to follow. I have had an electric pressure cooker (EPC) for several years and it has been great. But what I have found is that the EPC only has 1 temperature and only a 60 minute max cooking time. What I love about the Instant Pot (IP) is the versatility in choice of cooking styles and extended cooking times. But what really sold me and make me buy this IP, was the stainless steel inner pot - for health reasons. Be sure to check out the extra accessories that are available to use in your IP (such as spring form pan, strainer basket, sealing rings, silicon egg molds, glass lid, etc) as they will enhance & expand your IP experience. I definitely have recommended this product to several friends and it's just a matter of time before I wear them down :)  I know there are so many things I want to make and know that my IP will definitely be put to good use. Now will I ever use my original EPC ? Probably. But sadly it has been become a 2nd pressure cooker whenever I need one. That is, unless I add another IP to my arsenal. <3"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Worth it!", "review_body": "So far I love it.  The instructions are crap, so go straight to the internet where you can pick up lots of great advice.  My first meal was chicken and noodles and it turned out great.  My family loved it and is ready for more.. Is it a huge time saver... maybe on some things.  I could have roasted some chicken breasts with vegetables, and made some noodles and gravy in the same amount of time, but I would have had a much bigger clean up and prep.  The dish was super yummy and easy, so that is a win in my book.  Don't be fooled by the cooking time.  Even if your cook time is only 5 minutes there is a good 15 minute time period in the beginning to build up pressure.  Just be prepared for that.. I can't wait to try more recipes."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Set it and Forget it", "review_body": "While I'm not a fanatic, I use this machine a lot. Stews, beans, soups and meats mostly.  There's more that I can cook with it, but I'm not one to go as far as trying to bake a cake in a pressure cooker.  Why do I love it - cut/chop, throw in the pot, saute first (in the pot) if necessary, set the button and then forget it until it's done.  Stainless steel instead of nonstick makes me feel safer.  I have a smaller rice cooker (also stainless steel) that runs next to it.  Wait - did I mention re-heating in the Instant Pot? The steam function (with a little added water) re-heats just as fast as my microwave but with way more flavor.  Great for the winter, but I'll be back on the grill come April."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "So great. So cute. Fits on the counter, unlike the bigger one.", "review_body": "I use this thing almost every day. I previously owned the 6 qt and have passed that along to my mom so that it stays in the family when I need to make a big pot of something. I'm currently single and the only meat eater in the house, so this 2 qt version is absolutely perfect for me. I often cook a pound of chicken or one cup of rice in it and it's perfect. This weekend I put five pounds of pork shoulder in the thing (it was a tight fit, I admit) and in 2.5 hours I had perfect pulled pork. I am an unrepentant member of the Instant Pot Cult."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Love it!", "review_body": "We love the instant pot! I am not a brave home chef, but this was so easy and not at all scary! It cooks juicy flavorful chicken in 6 minutes. I will never cook chicken another way ever again. The 8 qt fit enough chicken to feed a party of 32 people pulled chicken sliders with enough leftovers to feed our small family for 2 weeks. I cooked boneless chicken breasts & thighs then used a handheld mixer to shred it. Added BBQ sauce and it was fantastic! Even small children that are picky eaters loved it.  They asked me to share the recipe at the dinner table. We usually like to add veggies to the ip while the chicken cooks so everything is ready at the same time. It is very easy to clean with dish soap and bartenders best friend powder cleaner for tough jobs. I usually put it in the dishwasher on the bottom rack and that is working great. I have converted 2 family members to join the ip life. My parents live close so I just cook theirs in my ip. We are so glad they invented this!"},

I was a little worried about it being \u201cglass\u201d and so thin, however, it feels very sturdy, safe, lightweight and quite nice when standing on it!  I have to say, we are also happy that our 2 year old likes to stand on it as she not only likes the display color, but to know that we can accurately know what she weighs too!  This was a great buy and I will recommend it to all my friends/family."},

I tried it out right away, and when I first stepped on it, I got an accurate reading on a bright blue screen. I usually weigh myself in the dark at 4:30 in the morning before heading to the gym, so the lit display was perfect. I stepped on the scale 3 times and received the exact read out every time.

If it can't get sheer fabric to unwrinkle, I have serious doubts that it can work magic on heavier fabrics. Another important point is that the steam lasts maybe 10 minutes. Then per the instructions, you must wait 15 minutes before filling. Um... that makes for a long session of steaming if you can't get the job done quickly. Unfortunately for me, I can't return this.

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Product review: why i gave it Five Stars", "review_body": "Bought from amazon, It was bundled, shipped for free and arrived early. Also being double boxed and incased with foam there was no damage.. As for the product itself, It is very easy to understand how to use this item. There is an, AS SEEN ON TV brand that I have read negative reviews on. I have never tried it but the online reviews of this one (Instant Pot IP-DUO60) along with youtube videos of actual cooking made me choose this one over it. I opened it, cleaned it with a drop of soap on a wet paper towel and went right on to cooking a 13 bean chili. Right away I was stumped. Eager to use my new shiny appliance, I had not pre-soaked the beans over night. No worries said the cooking guide. Altho infomercial skip over the warm up time of the unit which in some cases could be up to 10 minutes, the overall cooking is fast. So I stuck the beans (4 cups of water to 1 cup beans and 1 TBS salt and let it pressure cook for 4 minutes and then stay warming for 10 more minutes. simple enough. That gave me time to thaw & brown the meat, chop the onions and open the 16 ounces of tomato paste/sauce. when done I was in a hurry so I used the pressure release switch. OK.. here is where safety is very important. Nothing locks on this item until pressure is formed and by all means that is great because you never need to worry if something is stuck where it's pressure or a malfunction elsewhere. Be careful, obviously the steam will be hot but also, it will rise to the ceiling if you do it real fast and my concern for people who have lower ceiling than mine would be that you could damage the ceiling with moisture even if not the first time but over a period of time. so using a dish rag for safety being my first time, I let the pressure/steam out slowly and removed the lid. Strained the beans, added meat, sauce, seasoning, onions and then set the inner pot back in and let it pressure cook for 30 minutes. Then I turned it off and 20 minutes cooling down it was minutes from fully releasing pressure but there again, I was getting hungry so I released the last tiny bit of pressure and then.. A very large, very tasty meal was ready and I had used my very first electric pressure cooker. I even put some it containers and took some family members some to try and not only did they like it, their kids did as well.. Clean up!. Cleaning was easy and I am careful not to make a mess and get it inside the inner pot that is not removable and is where the heating element is. The only thing I had any issue with was the main pot. There were some spots left on it and I just haven't went back to read the book and see if there is a special way to clean it. All I used was a dish ran and dawn soap. I'm not used to cooking/cleaning in aluminum.. Hopefully this helps."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Kitchen workhorse!", "review_body": "I have a long history of wanting gadgets because I\u2019ve heard a lot about them and they\u2019re shiny and new. I held off on buying the instant pot for a long time because I have a slow cooker and a rice cooker, but eventually I caved and bought one. It is AMAZING. I started slow, with ribs and sweet potatoes. My obsession kicked into high gear when I bought Melissa Clark\u2019s new cookbook, Dinner in an Instant. Dried bean soups ready in less than an hour! Delicious chicken soups and stews! I\u2019ve used it at least twice a week with amazing results.. So why do I love it when my slow cooker has been gathering dust for years? It\u2019s so quick and easy!. - Slow cooker recipes tend to be bland and mushy. Not so with the instant pot. If anything, the flavor is more concentrated.. - My slow cooker pot is heavy ceramic and is difficult and awkward to clean. The instant pot liner is lightweight and cools down quickly, so I can clean it before any food dries and sticks.. - Also, I\u2019m not a morning person and the last thing I want to do after I wake up is prep raw meat and chop things for dinner. With the instant pot, I start dinner when I get home from work and it\u2019s ready\u2014usually within an hour and without constant monitoring.. Being able to saut\u00e9 in the same pot is fantastic too for adding flavor. I haven\u2019t tried the yogurt settting, but look forward to trying it. I ignore most of the presets and rely on manual. I\u2019m an instant pot convert now and can\u2019t stop raving about it to my friends and family. If you get an instant pot, do yourself a favor and pick up Melissa Clark\u2019s cookbook too. If you\u2019re at all a foodie, you\u2019ll love her recipes. I haven\u2019t been disappointed yet."},

Since it's so fast compared to a slow cooker I wonder if I should have bought the smaller model, but I've had it a few months now and actually think that since I jar up a lot of my soups, etc. I prefer to have the larger model. It is quite big, though. It requires a certain minimum amount of liquid, I can't recall what it is, but some recipes you'll find will list less water so you're going to have to adjust recipes by doubling or figuring out if you can just add more, otherwise it won't actually get the pressure high enough. I do end up doing the meat and veggies separately because it will overcook the veggies. Depends on what you're doing and what you're preference is."},

I haven\u2019t purchased yogurt in the grocery store in about a year because I make my own that tastes leaps and bounds better than the store bought stuff. Sure, it\u2019s a long process, but it\u2019s mostly hands off!. I can throw a frozen chicken breast in with some salsa and seasonings and in no time have fall apart tasty chicken for a few quesadillas, tacos, nachos...which is great for when I want something tasty but don\u2019t want to labor over some recipe that will make enough food for an army!. Mac and cheese in this thing is ridiculous! It takes MORE time to make the blue box stuff than in the IP...and the IP version is the creamiest and cheesiest ever! I take my whole pot and all the ingredients somewhat as a party trick when I take it as a dish and whip it up right there on the counter in no time flat and then keep the pot on warm to serve the cheesy goodness.. It takes some time to learn about it...read the instructions, study the recipes before you execute them, join the Facebook group to watch what people are doing with this thing (both right and wrong so you can avoid making the same mistakes!) and don\u2019t jump in and make something super intricate on your first go at making something in it, and you\u2019re set!.

We love being able to SAY NO TO CANNED BEANS FOREVER!  40 mins gives you great sodium-free (and more flavorful) beans.  Great for brown rice (rice/grains, in general, do need practice if you want to modify the rice:water ratio beyond the cookbook instructions.  easy cleanup (the lid and associated valves stay clear as long as you don't boil anything over by overfilling).  so, to clean, just pop off the lid and let is air dry.  scrub the SS  pot insert, dry and put it back together."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "The quiet, fast helper in your kitchen.", "review_body": "So, I will repeat what others have said.  The pot is non-stick which forces a person to use lots of fat for saute mode.  Not nice.  For me, this pot runs very hot and fast.  The good news is that food is cooked very quickly and you never have to peek under the lid, stir at the stove or turn on the fan.  It's quiet and fast.  The bad news is that veggies will cook so fast that they become mushy quickly.  One minute on the veggies is about right.  I've also discovered that rather than letting the steam shoot up all over the ceiling etc., it works well to release the valve slowly with the enclosed ladle and direct the steam with the bowl of the spoon!  This works well for me.  Instant Pot needs to manufacture  an optional non-stick pot that withstands the rigors of heat and pressure - I would buy it just for the saute convenience.  The Instant Pot is totally quiet when cooking, doesn't throw off heat into the kitchen and cooks soups and stews just great.  I'm looking for some really flavorful, low fat recipes for the cooker.  Got any?"},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Long cooking time", "review_body": "Overall this is a great pressure cooker. It seems to perform very well. Easy to clean up, etc.. I will purchase a smaller one for side dishes.. My only complaint is the time needed to actually cook the meals (from Instant Pot's recipes) is considerably longer than stated.. For instance - yesterday I made the curry chickpeas which was delicious - however, the total cook time was almost 2 hours.. I started my beef roast at 5pm and its now 5:36 and still showing \"on\" hasn't begun to countdown the 45 min cook time.. Very frustrating when you're trying to get dinner on the table at a decent hour.. Moving from scaling to venting is very precarious - adding a longer handle for safer rotation would be helpful."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I love my new Instant Pot cooker!", "review_body": "Love it! Used it right away. Had already watched some YouTube videos and learned a lot before it came in.  Made buffalo wings immediately (I washed it first) because already had them on hand. My husband really liked them. They were very good and tender. Actual pressure cooker time for 2.5 pounds of wings was 8 minutes - I kind of guessed because of what I had learned.  It also takes a few minutes for the pressure to build (depending how much and what all you have in there) so that needs to be included in the time factor. Before pressure cooking I used its Saute feature to brown them just a little. Also briefly crisped them under broiler before adding sauce (don't do this too long - don't want to overcook).  Just like some people like to sometimes brown meats a little because the crockpot doesn't, same thing here. Only instead of hours, it was only minutes - and very tender. Decided to go ahead and get the 8 quart instead of 6 quart and glad I did. It can cook a whole chicken in about 20 minutes and if you want to do some batch cooking. I will be using this almost every week.  It is a 7 in one pot.  It is also a slow cooker, rice cooker, sautes etc. I had always stayed away from pressure cookers because of olden-day pressure cooker war stories.  So glad I went ahead and tried it!"},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Who Would'veThought I'd Love Using a Pressure Cooker?", "review_body": "I never thought I would use one of these, but I love it.  Today in preparing for a BBQ, I used the Instant Pot to boil potatoes for potato salad, hard boiled 7 eggs, cooked ribs, and made corn on the cob. One of the factors for its success is the excellent stainless steel insert, which is extremely well-made, doesn't warp, and cleans up really easily between uses.  I always brown meat before braising or stewing, so I love this feature.  I've used it for pot roasts, short ribs, pasta casseroles, whole chicken, and many other dishes.  I found a good cook book , and checked out the many YouTube videos out there to get started. I reserve the fifth star because it's sometime tricky to get the silicone ring just right, but I'm better with practice.  I'm so happy with this product."},

I usually just throw everything raw into the crock pot and skip the gravy because it's too much cleanup. But this was perfect.  I'm still learning,  but it seems to be a very valuable kitchen addition. I love that something that used to take all day,  can now be done from start to finish in under 2 hours with the same or better results.

I got the 8-quart Duo Instant Pot on Black Friday, so that I could make larger pots of beans, soups and stews, and  I could have leftovers and freeze some for other days. The larger size is also better when you have a large family group and need to feed them! This stainless steel pot cleans so easily. I love good quality stainless steel. I use this Instant Pot not only many times per week but sometimes several times a day. So far today I have hard cooked a dozen eggs, I will be reheating some frozen soup later, and will probably make a pasta dish for when my son gets home from work tonight. The eggs peel so easily in the instant pot, that I will never hard boil eggs on the stove top again. Yesterday, I made some yogurt, which is delicious, and I know exactly what is in it.

It's very handy!. This is the most useful cooking appliance I own. If given the choice between keeping this or my stove, I'd pick my Instant Pot.. It has so many different abilities, I have only gotten around to trying half of them.. There have been no problems or glitches whatsoever with this machine in the two months I have had it.. As someone who hates wasting time and effort in the kitchen, I never got around to making things like ham and bean soup before.. This machine is so fast and efficient that I have made Goulash, ham and bean soup, and the most tender pot roast I have ever eaten in it!. If you are on the fence about buying one, I strongly urge you to pick one up.. The amount of money I can save by buying cheaper cuts of meat and making them soft and flavorful in this machine. has made the price I paid for this completely worth it.. I was skeptical about all the high reviews raving about this machine, but it's not just hype or influenced reviewing.. It really is a great little pot you'll want to tell people about.. I wholeheartedly recommend this handy little device!"},

Now I have had this for about a month I absolutely love it and it is quite easy and understandable. I love that it sautees, and then you add remaining ingredients.  I loved the chile I made and clean up was easy!  The stainless steel insert browns nicely, and then the steam helps remove the crusted remains.  I made corn bread in it, and I didn't realize it wouldn't brown. Tasty, but just looks different. Boiled eggs come out fantastic.  For our farm fresh eggs, the eggs peel easily and the inside has more of creamy and no green glow around the yolk edge.  I love soft boiled eggs, too, and Instant Pot gets them just right. Flavors are more enhanced, too.. I haven't tried my own tried and true recipes yet.  I recommend getting the Instant Pot cookbook with this. otherwise you won't know how long to cook your meal.. Actual cooking time for flavorful chile - 10 minutes but took another 20 to let the steam flow out.. My family loves that I'm trying new recipes and with easier cleanup, it's worth it."},

I cook at home every day and send my husband's lunches to work. We used them throughout the day, and we still have plenty.  I really enjoy not running to the store and lugging them home every week. The paper towels also so have pick a size. That way if you only need a small paper towel you don't have to waste them, and I think that makes them last longer. It's economical for me to buy them this way  because there is no cost for shipping and I also get a discount for subscribe and save, which saves a few pennies too. I get 12 packages with two giant rolls in them for 25.41 delivered to my door! That's about 2.12 a two roll package delivered to my door. These are giant rolls too.

After 5 years of washing and \"wear and tear\", the waterproofing material cracked and I had small pieces of plastic/vinyl all over my mattress. (Looked like billions of skin flakes....disgusting!)  I replaced the mattress protector with another product that was much cheaper and from a local discount store. Did not realize it at the time of purchase, but it was a pull-on protector that zippered at the head. What a hassle! And this discount protector billowed with air and really retained the body heat! Went on my favorite website, AMAZON, and chose SafeRest due to its reviews and materials. Boy, am I a happy customer! I have only had it for about a week, but it does not hold body heat, does not fill up with air, is easily washed and dried, fits very well, and does as it states...protects your valuable mattress from life's mishaps! I hope the waterproof backing holds up longer than my previous, more expensive cover, but if not, it is still very affordable to replace after a few years of washing and using.

{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Overall happy but some limitations", "review_body": "I've had my Instant Pot for a month or so now. I am happy with the Instant Pot's performance on the tasks I have used it for thus far. For example, I have used it once per week to make yogurt, and it does a great job. The first batch required a little more hands on time, as I figured out the process. But subsequent batches have required very little effort. I recommend draining the whey off of the yogurt if you like it thick, but either way, it is nice to be able to control the sweetener and flavoring of the yogurt, which always tastes very fresh. In addition, I have used the Instant Pot several times to make hard boiled eggs. They come out perfect after 5 minutes of low pressure, and are extraordinarily easy to peel. I have used the Instant Pot to steam veggies twice, and to make beef stroganoff once. Those came out okay, but I think will improve if I make adjustments to the cooking time and / or recipe itself. All in all, I am glad I have an Instant Pot. But I am giving it 4 rather than 5 stars because I think it has some limitations - I don't think chicken would cook very well, texture-wise, in the Instant Pot. Although it advertises a quick cook time, usually the cook time does not account for the time for the pot to come up to pressure, so it takes longer to cook some things than you might think, to the point that you have to think about whether it's just more efficient to use the stovetop or oven. And, given the size and shape of the Instant Pot, making many things (e.g., ribs, certain individual desserts, pork shoulder, etc.) requires either odd cutting of hunks of meat or odd stacking techniques. For that reason, I wish someone would come up with a multi-function electric pressure cooker that has shorter and wider design."},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "A True Game Changer", "review_body": "Busy soccer parents and students alike, if you value your time this electronic PC is sure to give you more of it. The instant Pot 7-in-1 pressure cooker has drastically reduced the amount of time I spend in the kitchen. When establishing my rating, I took into account the price point, overall durability, ease of use, and wide array of functions provided.. Even at full price, this machine delivered everything it promised and then some. However, if their Cyber Monday sales are any reflection of profitable profit margins, it could be lower. For one day last November pricing of the 5-quart option dropped to $49; as a result, I picked up another one. As far as durability goes, the only issue I\u2019ve encountered was due to user error.. Take heed and be sure to refrain from holding the Instant Pot solely by its lid, as it has a tendency to become unfastened. The only other grievance I have is the tone and frequency of beeps emitted when cooking is done or beginning, but this may only be an issue for those with a tendency to cook at odd hours of the night.. Of the many cooking settings, I have been most impressed by the yogurt maker, rice cooker and saut\u00e9 function. Being able to saut\u00e9 in the pot is a godsend, as it leaves all the tasty bits in the bottom not to be missed out on when other ingredients are added and set under pressure. Another example of versatility can be reflected by the slow-cooking application that is great for anyone who wants to draw out as much flavor as possible without using a separate appliance.. With the ability to set it and forget it, you can be in class and cook your lunch at the same time. Chili? Great. Carnitas? Done. Feel like hosting a spontaneous Friendsgiving later in the day? That completely frozen turkey sitting in your deep-freeze can be done in under an hour.. In summation, with so many innovative features the Instant Pot is a busybody\u2019s match made in heaven."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Best cooker on the market when purchased.  Use it all the time.  Set-and-forget controls aare perfect, as is the food.", "review_body": "We have used this dozens of times since we bought this.  I grew up with an old fashioned pressure cooker with the jiggly regulator that my parents would use all the time.  So I am very happy to see they added a microcontroller and sensors to this old standard.  I takes the old pots from a risky method of cooking to a set-and-forget way of making great food in record time.  We have made many chilis, soups, roasts, and sauerkraut with pork in this pot, and the only thing that doesn't come out perfectly each time is the roasts, and I think it's more my fault than the cooker.  Chilis work the best in a pressure cooker because all the flavors come out and blend in 90 minutes for what usually takes 4 hours or longer in a slow cooker.  The steel pot is removable and can be washed in the dishwasher.  Ours is still shiny like the day we bought it.  We don't really use the plastic utensils that came with it since we use \"real serving spoons\" with it."},
{"rating": "2.0", "review_title": "Come get mine. It's out on the curb.", "review_body": "I fell for the Instant Pot hype. It's changed people's lives! They can now feed their family healthier meals; husbands suddenly love cooking; it's so easy to throw a few frozen pieces of meat in and then Bam! you have dinner. Friends, I hate to disappoint you, but this isn't the miracle machine that you've heard about. The reason I pulled the trigger on getting  the IP, after reading countless 5* reviews, was to replace my rice cooker. I was excited to open up the box and immediately popped rice and water and hit the Rice button. Makes sense, right? What was produced was a gelatinous goo with a layer of water in top. And I burned myself. Twice. The area in front of and behind the handle is blazing hot metal! (You've been warned!). But I was not deterred. I read the entire manual and recipe book, did the water test, and realized that this is NOT a convenient \"set it and forget it\" appliance like my old rice cooker or crock pot. This machine is as needy and demanding as a sugar-crazed toddler. After the pressure cooking process, there's a whole dance of quick releases, natural releases, keep warm settings and a bunch of hot steam and potentially dangerous burns this working mom doesn't have time for.. I've tried at least half a dozen white rice recipes -- not free-styling it, actual blogs of people devoted to the IP movement -- with different time settings, different water to rice ratios, different brand of rice -- and none of them have given me delish results that I would share with my family. It's been too watery, unevenly cooked, or completely inedible. And unlike my rice cooker, the interior pot isn't nonstick so it's time consuming to clean out.. The IP and I had one last date tonight before I broke up with him for good. A \"foolproof\" \" melt in your mouth tender\" beef roast. The kind of thing I can put in my crock pot before I leave for work in the morning and come home to a delicious dinner (with al dente potatoes and carrots) in rich gravy. After browning the beef, sauteing onions and layering potatoes on top, I set the magic machine for 70 minutes (per a recipe I found online). After 70 minutes plus a 10 minute natural release, I had a watery mess of unseasoned shoe leather and disintegrated potatoes. I fished out the potatoes and did another 25 minutes, plus another 10 minute natural release. Still tough as old boots and tasted about as good.. I give the Instant Pot 4 stars for good construction (it's a solid, heavy machine). Functionality and convenience, zero stars. That averages out to what I think is a very fair 2 stars. I can't believe this is ALL user error. I mean, I'm not cooking sous vide or anything! Maybe I'm cooking things in too small quantities (like 2 cups of uncooked rice at a time)? Anyway, I'm not waiting around to find out what's wrong. The learning curve is just too steep and I'm just too busy to futz with another machine that's supposed to make my life easier but has actually added babysitting and cleaning time on top of my day.. Epilogue: I have bought a new rice cooker and couldn't be happier."},

{"rating": "3.0", "review_title": "Inadequately written manual.", "review_body": "The first instant pot that I ordered was defective and was returned to Amazon. Amazon was great in dealing with this return. The yogurt feature on the first instant pot would not hold a proper temperature. I talked to the manufacturer and they said that the unit was defective.  (I wasted a half gallon of milk and a lot of time on it.)  The second instant pot worked perfectly. I have not tried anything other than the yogurt feature so far since I just got the pressure cooker yesterday.  Please note, the reason I am giving the instant pot three stars is because the manual that comes with the unit had limited directions.  I had to spend way too much time trying to figure out how to use it.  With so many features, the manual should give explicit directions for each function.  There is an online manual that is more detailed and helped quite a bit at the Instant Pot website.  I purchased a SS Presto  pressure cooker last year from Amazon.  Since I have used a pressure cooker for many years, I probably will stick with the Presto cooker most of the time.  I cannot see how the instant pot will really save that much time."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "A must for all kitchens!", "review_body": "We have had the Instant Pot for a week now. I have cooked in it nearly every day. I've made black bean soup, PERFECT brown rice, roasts 2 nights, and pork chops with mashed potatoes. Every single dish was cooked to perfection. My husband swears that everything is more flavorful.. I love the fact that with the black bean soup, after it's initial cook phase, I added veggies for another 7 minute cook. The veggies did not turn black like they do when cooking on the stove. The celery was still green, the carrots still orange, etc. For one of the roasts, I also added carrots and potatoes. The flavors were so good and they did not mix wit the roast. One thing my husband does not when cooking on the stove is that the carrots make everything taste like carrots. Not so in the instant pot, everything kept it's own taste and did not mix with the others foods.. This is an absolute must in any kitchen! I may even get a second one, since with the roasts I had to cook the rice the traditional way so that they would be done at the same time."},

I soaked it in vinegar for over an hour and it still smelled of the pot roast spices so I am thinking it might harbor bacteria.  I did like the stainless steel insert.  I put in a totally frozen piece of rump roast and pressure cooked it for like an hour, even tho my temp gauge read 200 degrees it was still a little tough so I programmed it to cook for 9 hrs on slow cook mode.  The next morning it was tender.  So I am thinking I could have done this in my slow cooker I paid $35-$40 for.

Now with the Instant Pot, there's less clean up, the kitchen doesn't get super hot, and you don't have to supervise the cooking. It's fast, convenient and makes tasty food! The recipe book that comes with the pot is very good and the Internet is full of Instant Pot devotees sharing their favorite recipes, which makes learning how to cook in the Instant Pot easy.. Bought this on sale over Christmas and it's the best Christmas present! If you love to cook, you should get it. If you love to eat but hate to cook, there're even more reasons for you to get it."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Changes the way we cook dinner.", "review_body": "I've had my instant pot for 2 weeks shy of a year now.  I use it at least twice a week.  I use this as a rice cooker, pressure cooker, and occasionally as a slow cooker.  I have not tried making yogurt.  I prefer it over other devices as I can easily remove the pot and wash it without fear of dropping a heavy crock with slippery soapy hands that will break.  I have had some trouble in the past week with the gasket not sealing correctly, but it does say in the manual that the gasket will need periodic replacement.. My typical dishes I make in the instant pot are meats.  I can have a pot roast from fridge to table in 2 hours.  I have used it for soups as well as cooking sweet potatoes and spaghetti squash.. Over the past year the pot has held up well.  The unit itself is not to be immersed in water, but does have a removable power cord.  Programming is easy selecting between high, low, or normal pressure.  You can set a delay start time and then set the cooking time. While cooking there is some steam that comes out of the pressure and the overflow valve and it makes a gentle hiss/hum sound so you know it's cooking.  When it's done there is a beep, but not something you have to respond to.  It then goes into warm mode.  I've set things to cook on slow cook and went to work and come home to find them on warm for 45 minutes.  Cleaning is easy.  I'm not a fan of teflon as it will flake off so I'm thrilled that this does not have teflon.  For really tough suck on food, I fill with water and drop in 6 denture cleaning tablets.  The next morning I wash it out and store it.  The gasket is easy to get off and on for cleaning.  The only difficult part of cleaning is the drip container on the back to catch excess condensation.  I've only had to clean it once when I over filled the instant pot.. All and all, this instant pot has changed the way we cook.  It's great for this working mom."},

But we decided to give it a try.. The material that tucks around the corners of the mattress is quality. Feels like it's built to last. And it easily covered our 16\" thick king mattress with plenty of room to spare. It seemed to pull tight which is nice so that we don't get bunching under the sheet.. After we put the sheet on, we couldn't feel the coarseness of the terry cloth at all. And it seems to actually hold our sheet on a bit better as well. No longer slips off the corner of the mattress during the night..

I received my Instant Pot two weeks ago and have used it five times since then and every thing has come out tasting great. I first made rice just to try out the Instant Pot and make sure I knew how to work the controls, etc. My rice was light and fluffy, the perfect amount of moistness and no boil over on my stove like when cooking in a pan. Next I tried cooking chicken breasts (perfect), tomato soup, chicken vegetable soup and then baked potatoes. I am very happy with the Instant Pot and am looking forward to cooking  with it for years to come."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "wow never thought i would dare use let alone love pc", "review_body": "I returned another pressure cooker for this one, and it was the right decision: this unit is better built and the stainless steel insert is a good idea. I thought rice would stick to it but it didn't. I made yogurt with whole milk, and will never buy yogurt again from the grocery store as the home-made tastes fresher and is significantly cheaper. I am impressed. Do buy another silicone ring (savory food smell will stick to it and you don't want the smell to transfer to your yogurt). I also bought the glass lid (nuwave 9\") that fits the Instant Pot perfectly (about the same price but nuwave's lid is nicer quality, imho).. Update (3 weeks later): I made pork ribs, chicken and beef curry, rice, and yogurt in this pc. Everything came out really well cooked. I am sold on the yogurt function of this pc, I used mason jars (steam milk in them, no other pots needed), and we now enjoy yogurt every day! The beef curry is seriously addictive, and it only takes 35 min of stewing for tender texture (not mushy or tough). I do strongly recommend buying two more silicone rings, it is nice to not transfer smell from strong dishes (curry) to plain dishes (rice and yogurt). I also like the nuwave 9\" lid very much, it is very useful when you are reducing sauces after cooking food in the pc. I purchased another inner pot, as recommended by prior reviewer, now that I find myself using the pc every day. I honestly prefer to cook with the pc than the stove/oven. As pointed out by other reviewers, this unit is very quiet, except for beeps from the pc telling you dishes/cycle are done, there is no sound at all while it cooks your food.. By the way, the white rice (basmati) takes 3 minutes to cook (plus another 10 min to cool down naturally). To boil the milk for the yogurt it takes 1 min (that's right, one minute). The chicken curry 13 minutes.. Outstanding purchase. Kudos to the Instant Pot company for this wonderful product."},

Beans that went from dry to ready to eat in 20 minutes!. A few notes: while this says it works as a rice cooker, a friend with the same model passed along the note not to use it for that. The seal for the pressure cooker tends to slightly absorb the flavor of the last thing cooked and impart that into your rice. You don't notice in anything else, but rice will taste like the last dish prepared. I haven't used it for yogurt yet, but I'm buying a set of spare seals I can swap when I'm ready to make cheese and yogurt in here."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "As good as all of the good things you have read", "review_body": "I have had the instant pot for a few weeks but just opened it last night. I did the test run as recommended by the instruction manual as I had never used a pressure cooker before and then I made a 5 pound chicken. I was skeptical how it would turn out but it was fall off the bone tender and had great flavor. I set the timer and had steel cut oatmeal waiting for me when I woke up this morning and tonight my son and I made pulled pork in 75 minutes that shredded easier than any pulled pork I have made in the smoker (granted while this pulled pork was very tender the taste is nowhere as good as the smoked pulled pork IMO so I would only make it in this manner if I was in a hurry ... but I can't imagine a scenario where I needed to make pulled pork quickly). I bought this one specifically for the yogurt function (and dishwasher safe stainless steel parts) and will be trying that tonight.. UPDATE: In the last few days I have made homemade mac and cheese (from dry noodles to ready to eat in 20 minutes), yogurt, chicken stock (2 hours instead of a full day on the stove), homemade dog food (took 30 minutes when it used to take hours), beef stew and chicken noodle soup. I admit I am finding a lot of reasons to use if just so I can test it and will not use with this frequency in the future but it is awesome and will get plenty of use in my kitchen."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Absolutely love this!", "review_body": "I am so happy with this Instant Pot. I have used it only for the slow cooker so far but it has gotten so much use so far. I love that I can throw my chicken and all my veggies in and let it cook for however long I want. I\u2019ve been making bone broth, soups and anything that pops into my head. I am on a super restricted diet due to health issues and every meal has to be made fresh....no leftovers at all....so this comes in handy and saves me so much time. Plus it is super easy to use and clean. I have other crock pots but this size is perfect and it\u2019s so easy to clean. I set the desired cooking time and then when it\u2019s done cooking it keeps it warm."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "The best appliance I own...", "review_body": "And I have them all! This has transformed how I cook. It stays on my cooktop 24/7 and I use it all the time. I mostly use the pressure cooker feature but how cool is it to have the equivalent of 7 appliances out and convenient!. I have cooked mostly frozen meat in it and the results are always amazing. Quick, tender and delicious. Potatoes are a breeze.  I found a recipe for pressure cooker cheesy chicken, rice and broccoli casserole that takes 5-10 minutes to cook in the pressure cooker. I made pasta and sauce in it, putting the uncooked pasta in the sauce and letting the pressure cooker work. After 15 minutes, the pasta was tender - too tender, in fact. Should have quick-released the steam when the cooking time was up.. There are other units that look like this one out there but I chose this one because the company is constantly improving the models based on customer suggestions. It also has a stainless steel cooking pot, which I insist on. No non-stick in this house, thank you. It is a dream to clean and nothing sticks in it when you are using the pressure cooker feature.. There are websites out there devoted to pressure cooking. Check them out and be fearless! The old days of thoughts of exploding pots are over and I, for one, am thrilled. I have recommended it many times to friends and clients. All I can say is, What did I do before I had it?"},
{"rating": "4.0", "review_title": "Handy Little Kitchen Device", "review_body": "Purchased this based on a friend's recommendation.  This is my first time using the pressure cooking method and I have to say it is quite fun!  I don't think I would say it is a big time saver since pressure cooking requires the device to ramp up and create the pressure seal before the actual cooking time begins and then there is sometimes (depending on recipe) time after the cook time completes where the device then has to come down in temp and the pressure seal to be released.. The pressure cooker method is not as \"one and done\" as using a slow cooker; most recipes I've tried require browning the meat first or doing a saut\u00e9 before and/or after the pressure cooking is completed.  But the method does make for some great full flavored meals with meat that is very moist and tender.  And although I haven't tried the feature, I do like that there is a slow cooker option.. Overall it is a fun little device to add another cooking option to my kitchen.  It took a little learning curve to become familiar with all the buttons and options on this thing - but after the first use I figured out most of it."},
{"rating": "1.0", "review_title": "BURN BURN BURN", "review_body": "I would give the product a second star, but the lack of support takes it away.  A little history.  My wife wanted to buy a rice cooker, I suggested an Instant pot instead as it would do more.  She was right.  We got a good deal($75) before the holidays and I put in a serious effort to get to know this thing.  Right off the bat, I got a lot of 'BURN' notices (sic, remember the show?).  Even when using recipes specific to this item?  BURN.  Usually 2-3 before actual pressure cooking.  BURN, open, scrape/stir/add liquid, repeat.  Tomato soup?  BURN!  Sauce, stew, vegetarian/chicken/beef chili, pulled chicken, chicken stock?  BURN!  It takes a lot of the speed out of the thing, especially if you're not watching for the BURN, come back expecting a finished meal only to be disappointed.  I researched, changed how I stacked things in the pot.  Stopped sauteing in it completely.  BURN BURN BURN.  So, over a week ago I finally after waiting too long for an exchange and possibly return,  contacted Instant Pot's support.  I got an open support ticket with an email.....that's it.  Eight days and not a peep.  They mention a holiday backlog?  The holidays that ended weeks ago?  I even tried replying to my own support ticket to see if it kicked the tires?  Nope.  Either they're completely inundated with problems or incapable of support OR maybe I didn't reach the level of deserving support?  Any way you look at it, if you're thinking of buying this should concern you.  I am ashamed that I fell for the whole 'cult' thing that seems to drive this product, I thought I was immune to and wary of fanboyism.  To be fair, all but one batch of rice didn't 'BURN' nor did the one time one made chicken soup, so it's not all failure.  This is supposed to be a time saver and my experience proves it's anything but.  Even as a rice cooker, I tested it side by side with my stovetop method and starting from cold, the Instant Pot is almost a minute slower.  Buyer beware of the product and the fanboys that guard it like it's their child.  BURN!"},

(I have a batch of natto in my 3 Qt now.). I made a huge pot of bone broth in the 8 Qt--letting it slow cook for 24 hours. The richest beef broth I had ever made.  I used to hate peeling hard boiled  eggs. Now, its 5 minutes to cook, 5 minutes to rest, and the shells come right off smoothly, not leaving any nicks in the eggs. I could go on, but the bottom line is you can't go wrong with an Instant Pot."},

With a family of 4, I try to reduce our footprint as much as possible by recycling as much as I can. But there are still times where quite a bit of trash is generated.

Oh My Gosh! Everything you make in this tastes better! And who can beat a wonderful from scratch chicken noodle soup in 8 minutes? Where has this been all my life? It's so wonderful to know we can eat a delicious meal with no fuss even if I did forget to defrost things and I'm exhausted after a full day of work. Yes, I have put every frozen food imaginable in it, and just added a few minutes cooking time. Turns out great. My husband loves rice and he cooks up perfect rice every time. So far, we've used it for just about every kind of food without a fail. Plus, it's safe! I know pressure cookers have gotten a bad rap over the years. But this one is different.. I used a regular pressure cooker years ago but quit when my mom told me the story of her friend who had one blow up. The lady did survive, but I threw my old one out. The Instant Pot is different. It has 10 safety features to prevent a mishap. If the first one fails, the next kicks in, and so on. I don't believe it can blow up since these safety features immediately let the steam out to depressurize it. It really is safe because of all the backups.. So, if you love the speed of a pressure cooker but were ever worried about them, this is your solution. It replaces many other appliances, too, I keep it out on the counter, and our countertop space is limited, but it's worth it. It's always ready to go. If you use it as often as we do, you'll love getting an extra pot liner, too! Very convenient to store smaller amounts of leftovers in the fridge while you make a larger dinner meal.. If you are on the fence, go for it! You'll thank yourself!"},

The day it arrived I scoured the cupboards for something to cook. I tried a simple penne pasta recipe found on the web. It was amazing. I\u2019m not usually big on pasta, but the sauce was inside each penne, the pasta was cooked perfectly. We ate all the leftovers which never happens! In the first week I have tried chicken soup stock, minestrone soup, beef stroganoff, cream of mushroom soup, and salsa chicken. Every dish has been very simple, and very delicious. I love using only one pot to saut\u00e9, and cook the meal. So many less pots to wash. I love the heavy stainless steel inner pot. Not a fan of non stick coatings that eventually peel.

The problem is if food or liquid gets in between the stainless steel and plastic, there's no way to clean it easily without taking out you trusty phillips head screwdriver and separating the two pieces apart.  Then there's the recess area where the lid drops down into so that you can securely turn and close the lid.  Again, food and liquid can get into that area which can be difficult to clean.. Other than that, I found a new toy and it works wonderfully!  So far, I have made Beef Stew, Kalua Pork and a Roast.  All turned out excellent and it sure beats out the slow cooker.  Most things can be cooked within 1/2 hour not counting the preparation time.  It's one handy little unit and for a busy family that needs to get food out in a hurry ..... hard to beat!. Next up?

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I love the Instant Pot and the customer service is excellent.", "review_body": "After a few months, my instant pot started to leak steam from the vent at high pressure. The pot still worked great at low pressure, but I wasn't happy with the steam loss at high pressure. The company worked with me and determined that the steam sensor might have been letting the internal pressure get higher than usual, thereby releasing steam to prevent a safety problem. (The weight in the vent will never allow the pressure difference to get large enough for a safety problem to occur. The weak point is the vent and it will lift if the pressure goes higher than intended.) The safety features on this multi-cooker are very well designed and the customer service is fantastic. I have a new cooker (works perfectly), and I am sending back the first one. I am at high altitude, so the addition of pressure allows me to cook things that just haven't worked very well without this cooker. I will be getting the 6 Q for Christmas this year. I note that it adjusts the programs for altitude. I've gotten rid of my slow cookers and my egg cooker. Corned beef used to take all day and is done and tender pretty quickly now. Rice on the stove takes about 45 minutes, but is done perfectly in half the time with this pot. Being able to saute ingredients prior to cooking at high pressure (stews, risotto) is a great option. I'll be keeping one on my counter at all times. I've never bothered to write a review before, but I am just that pleased with this item and the company in general."},

So, to keep from taking a sledge hammer to it, I decided to try it out.. (maybe that was her plan all along.....). I am not a fan of traditional 'crock pot type meals'!!!!!. (too many pot lucks when I was growing up). I have to say - this thing is pretty amazing and I am glad we got it.  Even if I am the one that has to use it.  I've made 3 meals so far, and every one has been delicious.  Even our picky 5 year old liked them!. (he normally survives strictly on chicken nuggets). 2 things to know....... 1.  Prep time is usually 30min - 1hr for most meals. 2.  It takes 10-20min to reach temp and pressurize before the cook time starts, and another 5 - 20min to cool and de-pressurize.. So,  if the recipe says 5min cook time = 30min real time. Still, I cooked a 2.5lb pork roast in 1 hour (plus 15min warm up and 15min cool down)"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "No Pressure! Cooker", "review_body": "I purchased this pressure cooker earlier in the year but it's really only come into it's own in my house now that they holidays are upon us. Living alone it takes a bit of motivation to get me to cook in quantity so my use of the pressure cooker was limited until recently. It does a wondeful job with everything I've tried so far, but again, my use was limited.. Over the holidays though I decided I'd be a good guest this year and bring some dishes along with me. This pressure cooker makes it easy, and yes, even fun. My latest was a super simple Kalua Pig recipe (thing Hawaiian style pulled pork). The local supermarket had a great sale and I ended up with a 12 pound butt. I decided to take half to Xmas dinner and cook half later.. Because you really want to cook the pork down to the point that it'll shred easy with a fork a pressure cooker is great. It could take a day on the stove slow cooking, but in 100 minutes (and I probably could have done it in 90 but I wanted to be sure) I made short work of it.. The Instant Pot IP-DUO60 7-1 isn't the lastest version, that's bluetooth enabled version that costs about twice as much. I live in a small apartment so I really, really didn't need to be able to control things from my couch; it's a few steps to the kitchen.. The controls on the cooker are easy to use and fairly intuitive. A handy chart is included which I've put up on my fridge.. I've not tried the autosettings yet as most of the things I've tried have been from recipes that include cooking times, but I've no reason to doubt they work. Generally I use the saute setting to brown my meat; works great. Then I add some liquid, seal it up, and set the time. In a very short time I've got a great meal.. I have made both large quantities of single meats, like the Kalua Pig, as well as one point meals like a pork loin wit cauliflower (for mashing) with equal ease.. This is an electric pressure cooker so it won't develop quite the pressure a stovetop model would thus cooking times are marginally longer. However cooking times are so much shorter than they might otherwise be (100 minutes vs all day for instance) that it's not going to be noticeable for most things.. I'm very happy with this pressure cooker and am looking forward to my next challenge!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Can't Recommend it Highly Enough!!", "review_body": "We all have our preferences, but I absolutely LOVE my Instant Pot! I've owned dozens of electric and stove top pressure cookers over the past 3 decades and the Instant Pot outperforms them all. I guess I should thank my husband for destroying my old stovetop nonstick Kitchen Essentials--an expensive but well-made pot...but if anyone can burn a quality cooking vessel beyond redemption, he's the guy! LOL Fortunately, he stays away from my electronic kitchen gizmos.. There are so many things to like about the Instant Pot that I can't name them all, but just to touch on a couple of them: The stainess steel inner pot is as easy to clean as it is attractive. The 2-hour time limit on pressure is perfect for things that would normally take much longer--like bone broth, for example. No need to worry about overfilling the pot, as in the old 2/3 full rule. At times I've filled my Instant Pot about 1 inch from the top and it's worked beautifully (tho I wouldn't recommend this as a rule or frequent practice!). Also, I detest the flavor, and usually the texture, of slow-cooked foods, but I've been able to make two dishes so far that are a-ma-zing and have no \"crock pot taste\" that was such a turnoff with other slow cookers. If there's one drawback, it's the way the silicone seal holds the odor of the last thing you cooked. Running it through the dishwasher didn't help. Soaking it in a vinegar solution was pointless. I'll get a replacement seal, and follow some of the ideas posted in the Q&A section there."},

They still peel easy but no one cares because they are inedible.  Like I said it can't correct all my mistakes.. The best advice I read here was to get a second insert pot.

I guess the only negative is the price, I wish they were a little cheaper but I'm willing to pay because I really do think it's worth it.

I didn't think I needed this. I didn't believe the hype until my 92 year old friend insisted I reconsider the instant pot. #1 This cooker has overhauled my rice cooking experience. Worth the price as a rice maker alone. No more pressure cooker mess with making brown/multi-grain rice. No more sprays over the ceramic cook top. No mess period. The InstantPot has helped me keep my stove top cleaner overall.  #2 I'm eating more vegetables. Steamed vegetables are a breeze in minutes. I have had some rookie mishaps though. Unlike with regular pressure cookers, this requires sufficient water for any and all dishes! It will not generate water for you by cooking down the foods as you can expect with regular pressure cookers.It does not function exactly like your existing PC.  If you can accept with that, you're good to go. I haven't tossed my old PCs. I find they cook dry beans down better. I may still be in learning curve for beans though."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Thank you, may I have another...", "review_body": "This is the first pressure cooker I've owned or even cooked with.  So maybe I'm missing something.  But at this point I don't even care.. I have been using this to cook for me and my wife.  We usually cook enough to have leftovers since it's generally cheaper to purchase food items in bigger quantities.  This product has met all of my expectations and even exceeded them in some ways (it steams corn like a champ).  I've cooked beef roasts, pork loins, lamb shoulder, pastas (comes out overcooked), yogurt (LOVE IT), potatoes, and our favorite thing in this so far, whole chicken.  I have only used it as a pressure cooker (not slow cooker) since it makes quick work of most meals.  It's easy to use, easy enough to clean, and easy to adjust most recipes for it.  If this one every dies I will definitely be getting another.. One downside I can see is for larger families.  Like I said, I am able to cook whole chickens in it (about 4-5 lbs).  But for those that have more than 4 mouths to feed I would take that into consideration.  Of course it all just depends on portion sizes...  Maybe you could just buy two?. Another downside is that if you like things crispy (like chicken skin?) don't expect it to come out of a pressure cooker that way.  It would take a trip to the broiler or a skillet to get that crisp back.  But that's not a fault of this model, that's a fault of all pressure cookers.  So I wouldn't knock it any stars due to that."},

This seems to be one of those items.  I must admit that I have a weakness for kitchen gadgets and appliances.  So when I ordered this from Amazon, I figured it would be one more item that did not do very many things well, and I would rarely use it.  Being the eternal optimist, I figured it was worth a try.. The Instant Pot arrived a couple of days ago and I have put it through it's paces since.  I am all abut improvising, but to be fair, I have followed the directions to a tee for this cooker. After seasoning the pot as suggested in the operations manual, I have done several dishes.  I \"baked\" a large potato, made chili, cooked a great pot of oatmeal and pressure steamed frozen Cod steaks. Everything came out perfect.  I'm very impressed.  Tonight I am fixing pot roast with carrots and potatoes.  It should take about an hour, and I can't wait.  If my next few weeks continue on as positively as this began, I am planning to get rid of my stove-top pressure cooker, vegetable steamer & Crock pot and begin using this as my main cooking appliance.. The only negative thing I will say about the pot, is that I wish it were 8 quart rather than 6, but it works so well, seems crazy to pick it to pieces.. I'm very happy with this purchase."},

Does NOT cook rice perfect like the other rice cookers on the market that only cooks rice. Too many steps to start the cooking process and too many steps to wait in order to actually open the lid. Not convenient at all. In conclusion, pressure cookers are not ideal for rice cooking. The rice was a harder than normal, and when cooked rice was cooled down, it was harder compared to rice that was cooked in the other rice cookers. Disappointed that I fell for all the marketing and hype. Not worth the price, even the Black Friday price. Will return and purchase a cooker that specializes in rice only."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "LIFESAVER", "review_body": "There is not a good enough word to describe how much I love my Instant Pot.. After ordering I spent about two weeks afraid to take it out of the box. Visions of exploded pressure cookers, and angry looking skin burns flooded my head.. Needless to say, I was being ridiculous. This is seriously one of the greatest inventions known to man and hands down my most used kitchen appliance.  This can easily replace a rice cooker, slow cooker, steamer, regular pressure cooker, yogurt maker and more.. I originally went with this brand because it was one of the only ones with a stainless steel insert as opposed to non stick, and also because it looked like I could get rid of quite a few appliances (haha, as if) and use this as a catchall.  It is very well made, has a large following and the maker provides decent customer service.. The only small complaint would be that the timing sheet/ instructions given with the pot are way off, and I had to seach out other resources in order to get the most out of my pot.. I used this  Instant Pot every single day for three months when I first started playing with it, didn't touch my oven/microwave or counter top oven in that entire time.  Originally I was afraid this wouldn't be very useful for someone who eats an entirely plant based diet but I was completely wrong.  Basmati rice in 4 minutes, perfectly cooked.  Vegan yogurt overnight at a fraction of the cost of buying it ready made,  soups, curries, tofu dishes,  steaming.. what can't this thing do?. Definitely give it a try even if you are a little bit hesitant!. To make your life easier I am going to link over to some resources that really helped me out with learning this appliance.. Jill Nussinow also has a great website, and her books have been invaluable, she has the most reliable timing charts in her books and is very active on the Facebook plant based instant pot groups!. I also really like JL Fields' book and website, and she is also active on a lot of the instant pot groups on facebook that are plant based.. Please feel free to ask me on here if you have any direct questions!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Quit Looking and Just Buy It!", "review_body": "I was hesitant to try this, since I already own a plethora of cooking appliances including crockpots and pressure cookers. Throw them all away and just get this! It makes the best hard (or soft!) boiled eggs, pot roast, soup, meats, etc. You won't be disappointed. I use it nearly every day. It is way easier to clean than my crockpot or pressure cooker. I also recommend buying the glass lid for this, I think it is $11 on Amazon. The other day I was cooking acorn squash and after 20 minutes or so, it started beeping and said \"burn\" on the display. This message didn't come in my quick guide, so I Googled it, and found out that the Instant Pot is smart enough to know when something is burning- so it lowers the temperature of the pot until it is safe to release. I had my acorn squash on the steam rack, and couldn't figure out why it would be burning, so I assumed this was a malfunction of some kind and started prepping to return my Instant Pot. Lo and behold, when I opened the pot 10 minutes later, I saw one of the halves had turned over and some squash-y goodness had seeped out to the bottom of the pot and it certainly LOOKED like it was about to burn. After removing my squash (which was PERFECTLY cooked, despite the burn notice), I quickly ran it under water and the brown spot on the bottom of the pan immediately came off. I was floored. If you have a pressure cooker, then you know there is a HUGE possibility of having it sit in the sink to sit for a few days to get off charred bits. I think my pressure cooker STILL has some residual burn marks on it. I am beyond pleased with the Instant Pot. I didn't think I would love anything more than my pressure cooker, but this thing did it. It's also great for Paleo/Whole30 diets, which my family sticks to 80% of the time. Also, unlike my pressure cooker, I haven't had any issues with the seal in the Instant Pot. I feel like I was constantly adjusting the seal on that sucker. Another big bonus is this guy is electric, and unlike my stovetop pressure cooker, this frees up my stovetop and sort of gives me an extra burner. I was hesitant on which size to get. When I called my mom for advice, she said, \"I've never wanted a smaller dish before. I have only ever wished I grabbed a bigger one.\" and boy that is the truth. Also keep in mind, that if you do high-pressure cooking, you can't fill it all the way up to the top, so I recommend getting the 8 qt one. If you already have a pressure cooker, you will immediately fall in love- the process is very much the same. If you haven't ever cooked with a pressure cooker before, you might need to give it a few meals before you make any judgments. Quit stalking it and buy it already! This thing is legit amazeballs and I am sorry I didn't buy one sooner."},

These are supposed to last 3 times that amount so I figured when I changed it on March 1 that I would not nead to change it again until the end of May or June, but 30 days later, March 30 this new blue LONGLAST filter has slowed to one single drip about every 10 seconds or so.. I tried to shake the filter and re- rinse it but still just the slow torturous drip!  The problem I think is the design which has the filtered water coming out of slots in the side rather than holes in the bottom like on the original filter.. So the LONGLAST filter is lasting me less than the original.  The only thing that is 3 times more is the Price!"},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Now that I have it I'm not sure how in the world I went so long without knowing about electric pressure cookers!", "review_body": "I initially began my search looking for a rice cooker.  we wanted to try making sushi at home and one of the things I read just about everywhere I looked was that buying a dedicated machine to preparing the rice would not only result in better and more consistent sushi rice but would make it easier and faster to do and this something we would likely do more often.  After looking at dedicated rice cookers in the $100 price range I kept seeing the Instant Pot line come up in various discussions.  While I was aware of traditional pressure cookers (i.e. heated by your range) I was not aware of these modern electric designs that offer most (slightly less psi) of the benefits of the old school pressure cookers with modern conveniences such as preset timers and a lot of safety devices.  After doing a bit of research I decided to spend a little more in the hopes that the IP would meet my rice cooker needs and then offer me an entire new way to cook (that seemed to be the promise at least).  After about a month and having made sushi rice, brown rice, and trying other recipes our household is absolutely in love with our Instant Pot.  Rice is a simple affair of just measuring, setting, and forgetting.  We started out with really basic recipes (i.e frozen chicken and salsa) and are now getting into more complex recipes that incorporate the instant pot in addition to other cooking methods.  The IP has officially taken over what used to be our Sous Vide bucket spot which has at least for the moment been demoted to pantry status!  It really is amazing how many things once can prepare with next to zero prep and active involvement.  With a one year old running around our house, any meal that we can prepare so hands off is a meal we can get behind!  Highly recommended."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Instant Pot", "review_body": "Instant Pot. I purchased these because a friend told me how wonderful it was and how fast meal preparation was. Being a busy on the go mom, I figured I would give it a shot. Well after purchasing I cooked in the pot about 3-4 times before it broke. Since it was still within the 30 days I was pleased that Amazon sent me out a replacement within 2 days. Guess you could say I got a dud the first round. Now that I have my second pot it is working well and I have had no issues with it. It is a quick way to prepare meats from frozen to done in about 30 min or less. The IP I have is a  7-in-1 Multi-Functional Cooker--Pressure Cooker, Slow Cooker, Rice Cooker, Saute/Browning, Yogurt Maker, Steamer & Warmer. Please refer the user manual before use. Must do a test before cooking in it for the very first time. If you have never used an pressure cooker it can be a bit overwhelming at first but after a few uses you get the hang of it. Include in your purchase is a 3-ply bottom stainless steel cooking pot, stainless steel steam rack with handle & manual and recipes in English, Spanish, Chinese and French and 2 spoons. I am still learning to use the IP and I am hoping I don't have any more issues like with the first IP purchased. I can say this, if the pot I am using now stops working I would not purchase another IP. I would want a refund of most of the money spent on it. I think paying as much as you do for something it should last for years to come."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I've always loved my pressure cooker -- grandma's microwave -- but the ...", "review_body": "One look at the Instant Pot and I wondered why nobody else had thought of it first.. The Instant Pot combines the features of a slow cooker and a pressure cooker but can saute very well too.  I've always loved my pressure cooker -- grandma's microwave -- but the Instant Pot can be programmed for delayed start and for cooking time, which no standard pressure cooker can do.. Cooking with it takes a bit of getting used to, but not much, and it's worth the effort.  My 2 cents: the cook time that displays when you start the unit does *not* include time getting the contents up to pressure.  The food does cook, however, while the pressure develops.  I scorched a couple of dishes by not taking heatup time into account.. But I can hurl frozen meatballs into the pot, add a jar of marinara and extra seasonings, set the timer for 5 minutes (of pressure) and in about 15 minutes, the meatballs are cooked thoroughly, the sauce is hot and the seasonings are fully incorporated.. Definitely a smart purchase."},

I paid $132.00 for a new \"Instant Pot\" as a gift for my single son. He only used it a few times before getting sent out of town for business. He left this Instant Pot cooker at his apartment, and it was not used until he got back 8 months later. He finally got interested in fixing his own food verses eating out like he had been doing for way too long. He started looking for new recipes, fixed two meals and then became bummed when the cooker wouldn't even heat up! So, he's used this at the most 8 times. I have two crock pots that are over 15 years old that I use weekly, and they still work perfectly!!

So happy that I did!. Threw out the rice cooker and slow cooker after just a few days with this thing. I used to either: 1. take frozen meat out of freezer and place in fridge, now obligated to eat said food in a few days whether we were hungry for it or not, or 2. wake up and make breakfast AND dinner and throw it in the crockpot and let the thing run all day when nobody was home (being a fire bug, I was never very comfortable with this.. Now we eat straight from frozen to plate in usually 20 to 40 minutes for most meals that we eat. I buy a lot of frozen individually wrapped items at costco. One of our favorite meals is salmon and a microwaved vegetable. No oil, no thawing, no falling apart teflon pan getting in our food.. I simply pour half a bottle of bottled water in the bottom of the instant pot, put the little round steamer rack in (water just below the rack), place frozen salmon (covered in pepper, old bay blackened, salt and cilantro (10 seconds to shake all of these spices on)), turn on instant pot, press \"steam\" button and walk away! About 10 to 12 minutes of warmup time and about 7 to 8 minutes of steaming under pressure, release steam valve, open... And have some of the most moist salmon I've ever eaten! Bag of frozen steamable veggies takes 5 minutes in the microwave. Literally a super healthy meal from frozen to plate in like 20 minutes!. Chicken breasts same thing except no steam rack, just toss them into the water in the bottom. I made pork ribs (youtube video showing apple juice and apple cider vinegar, starting in instant pot and finishing in oven to carmelize bbq sauce) and again, some of the best fall of the bone ribs I've ever made. Chicken wings with rub powder... short time, fall off bone delicious as well. Even made an apple crisp in the thing, and of course while not \"crispy\" right out of the pot itself, still amazingly tasty and could have finished off in a 450 degree oven for 5 or 10 minutes if I chose to, but I just wanted to eat :P. Made a meatloaf on the steam rack sitting on foil, again moist!. Seriously, only had this thing for a few weeks now and it has become our nightly meal maker. I've gotten into the routine of taking out 2 round racks to place the top and pot on, after cooking, etc. You'll find your groove with the thing and there are a lot of options, but the learning curve is quick and you'll find how you like to use the thing. But for me, I wish I would have learned about this device years ago!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "One of My Best Purchases Ever", "review_body": "I add this appliance to one of the best purchases I've ever made.  There is a concern over the safety of pressure cooking, but there are so many safety features built into this appliance that to me it's not an issue. You will learn to use this intuitively in no time. Just like the microwave, use it enough and the time and programming features will become second nature. I can make a pot of vegetable or chicken stew, or pasta with home-made sauce and vegetables, etc. in a big batch in 20 minutes or less that is infused with rich flavor from the pressure cooking. It gives me a week's worth of very nutritious, healthy meals. Happily, it has already paid for itself in less than a month. Not only does it not heat up the kitchen or require my gas stove to inefficiently heat the outside of a pot to cook the contents for a much longer time, it reduces the need for air conditioning formerly needed to compensate for using the gas stove in the summer. It also cut my food bill in 1/2 because I am not buying any more pre-packaged, processed meals. Even after a busy, tiring day of work I can make a quick meal in it and eat for a week. There is no need to purchase quick ready-made meals any more. The food I make in this tastes better and is better for me with no preservatives or additives. Tips:. 1. The manual suggests steaming hot water in it when you first use it. DO IT. You will sanitize the inside that will be touching your food from the factory/manufacturing process as well as get you used to the controls. 2. Remember to use your left hand to open the steam valve. If you use your right hand, the palm of your hand will get the first hot steam release when you open the valve which also likely contains drops of hot water. 3. After the first sanitizing cycle, wash the interior of the stainless steel inner pot with soap and rinse thoroughly. Wipe the interior dry with a white paper towel. I found the stainless steel pot left a slight coloration on the paper towel. I washed and repeated with dish soap until the towel remained white. Otherwise this coating from manufacturing will end up in your first few meals. 4. Always wash the pot with a paper towel, dish soap and water or soft sponge. Let it soak if needed. Don't wash in a dishwasher or use harsh abrasives. Use Barkeepers Helper powder lightly, only when needed. Most food remnants just wipe out when cleaning because of the steaming process during cooking. 5. Don't underestimate the natural release method for continuing to cook food while the unit is completely off. Consider planning it into your cooking time to save on energy. 6. Take the inner pot out of the cooker to reduce the heat to the food when it's done, especially pasta, so your food doesn't continue to cook in the pot, even when the lid is off. 7. Read the manual and recipe book given with the unit to learn the tips, and cooking methods pre-tested and tried with the appliance. It will help you when you need to adapt/adjust and use the cooker with your own recipes. 8. After you wipe down or rinse the lid, store it upside down on top of your pot so the seal breathes and releases some of scent it picked up from your last meal. 9. Invest in some glass containers with silicone lids to save/refrigerate your food. I am uncomfortable putting hot food in plastic to cool and store my food for a week because it stains, warps, and could leach chemicals into the food. I use Anchor Hocking True Seal Storage containers. 10. Before you put on the lid, check that the seal is seated correctly. Give it a slight turn (it should turn freely) or run your finger around the top of the seal to insure it's properly seated. Wipe the tops of the inner and outer pots to be sure no food or spices have landed on them. 11. If the steam button hasn't popped up and sealed the pot after a reasonable amount of time (you'll see steam coming out of the steam button but it isn't lifting to the lock position), steam may have lifted the whole lid up slightly with pressure and not the button. It happens. Just push down on the handle of the lid at the center of it, you'll hear a slight whoosh and the button will close. 12. After every use, remove the pressure release knob located on top of the lid. Turn the lid upside down. Let water fill up the underside of the lid until you feel a stream of water running out of the short pipe where the pressure release knob normally sits. Slightly press up the steam button enough to let water run through it. This will insure you don't have any starches or food in those important areas which could prevent the proper seal from occurring. 13. Rule of thumb for actual cooking time, not heating, but actual steam cooking time: 1/3 of your recipe's cooking time using conventional recipes. 14. In order for steam to occur and the pot to seal, you have to have at least 1 1/2 cups of water or water-like liquid (wine, chicken broth, etc) or more. Enjoy!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Replace your microwave! The multi uses of IP - reheat, pop corn, saute, defrost...", "review_body": "I am one of those people who don't read manuals. this is replacement for my old pressure cooker. i use it like the way i had made use of my old p cooker - only as a pressure cooker. yes, i forgot this IP is so much more powerful and multi functional than my old p cooker.. It is not until when i was looking to buy a microwave and chance upon an online video by someone promoting how IP can 'sort of' replace microwave. she showed how using the \"steam\" function could heat up food. It isnt as instantaneous as microwave (depending what you heat up: about 5-10 mins in IP vs 30sec - 2 mins in Microwave). It isn't as convenient as microwave either but after weighing the pros and cons, i think i can live with a little inconvenience and waiting a little few more mins to eat healthier. I will not go into the specifics of using microwave because there are a plethora of articles online about the ills of microwave although not that i necessarily support all of them (the radiation is so little for the amount of use at home to be harmful) and i probably will continue using a microwave if i have one but my current kitchen did not come built in with one. With the IP, i am glad it provided me an option so I can do with one less kitchen gadget in my kitchen.. So with this video, i began to find more videos and explore the many creative uses of the IP - there are SO MANY videos and reviews out there by independent IP lovers who share their tips and recipes on using IP (sure beat reading the boring manual). The other reason i was shopping for a microwave was to make pop corn. Well, i learnt on these videos that IP can pop popcorn too! Some of these videos are so detailed and many down to the science of perfecting the flavor, texture using different types of oil, organic etc etc.. A couple super legit websites that I found are \"sisters under pressure\" and \"Traditional Cooking school by Gnowfglins\".. Btw, I tried popping commercial (store-bought) microwavable popcorn in IP - they didn't pop - so you would want to follow the recipes to only pop raw kernels when using the IP.. My IP now has now moved from inside the cabinet to a permanent spot on my counter (like how your microwave would have taken a prominent real estate in your kitchen).. My favorite use for the IP: making soup, reheating food (everyday multiple times), defrosting and cooking meat usually a roast.. I got the 6 qt 7-in-1 on Black Friday 2016 at a deal - just under $70 on Amazon!"},

I've cooked every night since I got the instant pot. It's literally amazing. It's compeletely safe and easy to use. The instructions to set up the pot are not intuitive, so I recommend checking out YouTube. There are so many amazing recipes you can make in this pot too! Desserts, stews, all kinds of pasta dishes, it's awesome! There are also guides online of how to convert your favorite recipes into instant pot recipes. I recommend buying two recipe books off of Amazon to get you started; \"Instant Pot Electric Pressure Cooker Cookbook\" by Laurel Randolph and \"Great Food Fast\" by Bob Warden. Also, the must need accessories for beginners is the clear glass lid, which is helpful for storing leftovers and saut\u00e9ing, extra sealer rings, because you don't want your cheesecake smelling like beef stew, and a steamer basket for vegetables!"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "I'm Very Impressed with this Pressure Cooker", "review_body": "I have been petrified of pressure cookers since I was a kid.  Watching that little gauge with just a small bar which was to be in the center of the gauge as the whole thing rocked back and forth giving off steam and threatening to spray the entire pot's contents all over the kitchen from ceiling to floor.  Years later, my mother-in-law told me how her pressure cooker of beets literally did spray all over the kitchen and they had to repaint the kitchen!  So, here I am retired and I'm finally getting my first pressure cooker ever...and I LOVE it.  This particular item was very well reviewed and it literally has 10 safety features.  I read and highlighted the manual to be certain I understood how to operate it and off I went on my first pressure cooker adventure.  I made pork chops in gravy and they were delicious.  After I browned the chops, they cooked up in just 18 minutes.  The pressure cooker never made a sound other than the occasional soft click as the heating element clicked on or off.  I can't wait to try my next recipe.  YUM"},

When you're getting near the end of the bag, there's a black line that appears.  The beginning of that line usually can reach the bottom of the Genie to fill up one more time.  Now, sometimes when you're emptying the bag, you simply cut it where's it's full and that cuts into the black line... which may screw up having one last bag because now it's too short.  Next time, cut the bag at the start of the black line.  This may leave a few diapers in there, but those will just sit there a little longer and be in the last bag.  That way, you use up as much of the bag as possible.  Just a little advice from a stay-at-home dad."},

That has not been my experience.  The instructions state that you should run a test with the cooker right away.  I followed those instructions and I had Mount Vesuvius.  Water was everywhere, leaking all around the seal and dripping off the counter.  The popup never popped.  I called the 800 number in the book and a lovely gal talked me through the problem with another test.  The results were the same.  She indicated that the item sounded defective and that I should return it through Amazon.  She also let me know that, if I had any problem with Amazon, to call them back and they would handle the return.  I actually received my new pot the day that I shipped the defective one back- free shipping.  I have run the test and this one is definitely working.  So for those of you who are inclined to purchase gadgets and let them sit around until you are ready to cook something, I highly recommend that you run the test right away as directed.  Even if it is a gift, it is easy enough to repack after the test."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Everything I hoped for and more! Fast, easy pressure cooking", "review_body": "I waited all year for this baby to go on sale for Black Friday. I'd heard so many good things about this Instant Pot and I couldn't wait to try it. At first glance it can be a little intimidating with all it's buttons and functions and the big, fat instruction guide. I would recommend reading through the instructions carefully for the first time use, especially with emphasis on the different releases and how they work. I failed to do so as I somehow thought it would be wise to just dive in and explore it. I almost burned my fingers off not realizing how much steam would be released when you do a quick release, or what that really meant. Definitely make sure it is not right under hanging cabinets when you do a quick release or the wood can get damaged. In any case, my honey lime jalepeno stew meat was juicy and fall-apart tender in only 1 hour's time so I am an extremely happy customer. I am so happy to get rid of my crockpot and use this now instead for much quicker meals. It's easy to get used to once you've used it a few times. I'd say it took me a day of playing around to feel fully confident using it. I am really impressed with this little powerhouse of a machine. I plan to make plenty of stews, soups, curries, and casseroles with it in the near future! I highly recommend it."},

The rice setting is automatic at 12 minutes low pressure. I had the seal valve set to seal. Suddenly when the pressure metal popup went up, steam poured out of the sealed setting valve like I was releasing the steam. I called the company, and didn't get a really good answer, but I'm assuming when you set it to seal, thats exactly what its suppose to do,maybe if a little wisp of steam came out that would be fine, but on mine it came out intensely, so obviously something is wrong with the unit. so Im replacing it with amazon. Amazon was great about it they are sending me another unit. I guess either the valve isn't sealing properly or i just got a defective unit."},

{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Let me knock you over the fence...", "review_body": "There are no words for how much I ADORE THIS POT. I'm an official Instant Pot-Head. Ever since our normal pressure cooker exploded and bathed the entire kitchen and much of the family room with corned beef, I've been frightened to use a pressure cooker. But I'm not scared anymore. The Instant Pot has changed all that with safety features that tell you if you've got the lid on properly, or if you're burning something.. I've made bone broth of all kinds in it just in the first week. I had been using my slow cooker for as much as 24 hours to get the same amount of collagen output I get with this digital pressure cooker in just a couple of hours. It pressure cooked six raw boneless skinless thighs and two still frozen chicken breasts in under 12 minutes (I made pulled BBQ chicken sandwiches out of those). I made split pea soup in an hour that was perfectly smooth and required no blending at all. I made chicken and dumplings (from frozen chicken) in about an hour as well. Also made pot roast (from 3 lb. frozen roast) with mushroom gravy in one hour. Made the best Mexican beef for tacos and burritos I've ever eaten. The meats are always soft and tender -- and OMG, so fast. A great way to make more affordable cuts of meat unforgettable.. Oh, and puhleaze...I can't forget to tell you about the big acorn squash that cooked from start to finish in 8 minutes! (It's usually an hour or more in the oven without the results being as creamy and delish.). You don't have to brown your meats and veggies in a seperate pot on the stove -- the saut\u00e9 function works so well on this, I just brown things, and then use the pressure cooking function. There are lots of presets on this, or you can use the manual settings.. Now -- besides these wonderful meals I've already written about -- I'm getting so excited about making my own yogurt and cottage cheese (both of which are always in our refrigerator). I would advise those of you who will be making items that don't require the pressure top (like maybe soups, or steamed veggies) to buy the glass cover for the pot. The normal cover works fine, but I like to take a peek through the glass at things that are simmering in there.. And this pot makes rice and congee, too. (Haven't tried it for those things yet.) It's a fast cooker, a slow cooker, a rice cooker. There's just so much it does to make dinner more wonderful and delicious.. Anyway...if you've been on the fence about this item...let me just knock you over. Get one. It's amazing."},

I think would make a great gift if that's the price range of the gifts you give, especially to people who have limited time for cooking such as busy moms working families and those who want to keep it in something like an RV for travel ..  The only caution I have is to make sure you add the time that it needs to pressure up and pressure down from starting the recipe to serving it to your family ."},

The one my parents had was scary! Huge, heavy, steam coming out of it with a lot of noise. Very happy with the Instant Pot. There's unique recipes on Pinterest (Instant Pot Manna, for one), bought a few cookbooks, and made Osso Bucco for dinner tonight in my Pot. The real Instant Pot was the best pot considered, I did the research, and it's easy to use. I bought all the utensils recommended also; wanted to be Girl Scout Ready if a recipe required anything. It's nice to get off work and put the ingredients in, and wait for the little beeper to go off while relaxing. This pot also cooks a meal with frozen meat, in case you forget to sit it out/put it in the fridge to thaw. I bought an Instant Pot to promote healthier eating, and it performs, and you can work any meal into pressure cooker times so any meal can be produced. It also rotisseries a chicken."},

This thing is awesome! I now do 2-3 dinners a week in, mostly using the saute and pressure features.  I bought a couple of cookbooks and all of the recipes have been quite tasty.  This is not like a crockpot, where at the end you reveal that all meat tastes the same after being broken down in a slow heat.  No, instead, all meats retain their own delicious flavor.. Also, my god... Indian food in this things is the absolute best.  I bought an Indian Instant Pot cookbook and every meal has been like dining in a restaurant.. Clean up is also shockingly simple.  Nothing sticks to the pot and having to cook with a minimum amount of liquid for pressurization purposes means that nothing really ever burns to the bottom (or at all!). Amazing device.

In the case of this mattress pad we were just hoping that it would be a pad that didn't crinkle when our daughter moved around on it, that it didn't trap body heat when she slept on it and if she did have an accident on it that it would clean very easily.  So, imagine my joy when it met all three of those criteria.  I am not just happy but ecstatic with this purchase.  It is a mattress pad that breathes and is easily washable.  On top of that since it isn't an old fashioned rubber cover it doesn't make a sound.  In fact, put a bed sheet over it and it looks just like a thin mattress pad.. As I said, I am very happy with this purchase.  You simply cannot go wrong with this pad.  The 30 bucks or so that we spent is nothing when compared to replacing a mattress.  I also want to give a plug to the company that we bought this from, Everyday Pure.  I actually got the pad in a matter of days and it was well packaged and exactly what I expected based on their description of the product on their page.  A great company selling a great product.  You can't go wrong with either."},

If you've previously used a stove top pressure cooker, you will have no problem learning to use this cooker.  If you are totally new to pressure cookers, there is a slight learning curve.  Just remember that you MUST add water to cook in any pressure cooker, and please don't try to cook things like T-bone steaks that need to be cooked on a grill or any item that are best when cooked by other methods.  The manual and cookbook that comes with this cooker is difficult to follow so you may want to order a good basic Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker cookbook when you order your Instant Pot.  I purchased.

Made pulled pork, cheesecake, beef roast, etc.  Everything has been delicious.  I still think it's easy to use and clean.  One tip - for almost every meat I've cooked, I use the natural release method.  I think it needs that extra time to finish cooking.  Some reasons why I like it so much and use it often:  It's simple; it's large enough to cook good-sized portions; it has plenty of options for cooking; can saute and brown meat right in the same pot; don't have to babysit it while it's cooking and depressurizing; and it doesn't heat up the whole house.  I'm really happy with this purchase.. Original Review:  Received the Instant Pot (IP) Thursday.  Reviewed the instructions and found some keto IP recipes on Friday.  Purchased all the ingredients and cooked ribs on Saturday.  Cooked Corned Beef and Cabbage, Pork Roast with Mushroom Gravy, and a whole chicken on Sunday.  Everything was delicious, and the IP was easy to use (you MUST read the instructions!) and very easy to clean.  We're going to use the IP regularly because it saves so much time and everything turns out well.  Now I want to purchase an extra inner pot to speed up the process when I'm cooking multiple recipes.

Add to that a childhood experience of my mother blowing up the kitchen with a stovetop pressure cooker, and I was a pretty hesitant. The Instant Pot's sudden popularity among my friends convinced me to try it, half expecting I would return it unused.. Well, I'm a pressure cooker convert. Following directions on timing is pretty critical.  I've tried making rice, soup, meat, and vegetables and almost all of it has been successful. The one failure was baby brussel sprouts. I didn't back off the recommended time for larger sprouts, so I ended up with little balls of mush. One thing to be aware of is that for relatively quick to fix things like rice, pressure cooking won't be faster because there's warm-up time, then the shorter cooking time, followed by the depressurizing period. All in all it takes about the same amount of time as stovetop cooking for things like vegetables and grains. However, tougher cuts of meat and legumes are much faster in a pressure cooker. The flavor is superior too. Even for the foods that don't enjoy a time savings, it's nice to just put it on and leave it to do its thing.. I've also used the slow-cooker feature, sauteing meats in the pressure cooker pan before cooking them. I haven't tried canning or making yogurt, but I have a friend who uses her's for yogurt and loves it.  All in all, I'm glad I bought the Instant Pot."},

I bought one for myself a month ago and love it so much I decided to give one to my brother for his 75th birthday.  I bought the 6 quart even though the 3 quart would have been fine for single person cooking but I wanted to cook Pot-In-Pot for smaller portions and I wanted enough room around the inside pot or bowl that I can get it out easily without burning myself.. Today I made fall off the bone ribs (see photo)...soooo good.  I placed half rack of ribs in a pyrex bowl inside the pot for easy clean up.  After I let the cook in the pot for 60 minutes I coated them with BBQ sauce placed them in them under the broiler for 7 minutes.  Perfect."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Love it but it has a few little issues.", "review_body": "Love this so far, but there are a couple of things to be warned about.  I suggest right away you buy extra seals.  The seal picks up the smells of food and you may want, as some of the extra seal packages suggest, to have one for sweet food, one for spicy, and one for general.  I finally got rid of most of the smell by soaking in vinegar, then washing in dishwasher, then putting outside to air out.  This is my one complaint.  The only other issue is the manual is not really clear on some things.  You will find your best help online."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Amazing!", "review_body": "I have a ton of kitchen gadgets and this has replaced several of them. I no longer use the stove top pressure cooker (which was kind of scary), the rice cooker, the yogurt maker, and the slow cooker.. One of my favorite features is the delay start. I let the beans soak all day and then the pressure cooker cooks them right before I get home. I only use this feature with beans as I would be afraid meat would spoil. I should also add that the pressure cooker comes up to pressure much faster than the stove top pressure cooker did.. I also love the slow cooker feature that cooks for the time you program and then switches to keep warm. No more over cooked mush in the slow cooker!. Brown rice turns out fluffy and perfect. I seriously use the InstantPot a couple of times a week.. One of the best features is the stainless steel interior which cleans easily and does not leech nasty chemicals into your food. This is one of the only cooks I have found with this feature.. This product has saved me so much time and created more counter space since I was able to replace several gadgets with one!"},

I LOVE making soups and this goes from frozen chicken parts to homemade chicken noodle soup in 40 minutes. I had an old fashioned pressure cooker with the jiggly piece on the top. This is SO. MUCH. BETTER. I used it all last winter for soups, stews and misc. meals. I love that you can saute in it and then switch to pressure cooker or slow cooker. This winter I'm going to see if there's anything it CAN'T cook. I made many wonderful things...including a crusty pudding dessert with apples. YUM!  LOVE. LOVE. LOVE this Instant Pot. Just the right size for me......makes enough meals for me for a week. And they're really healthy and my own good ingredients."},

I have only cooked rice and hard cooked eggs, so far.  Liked the quantity of rice I did and it was quick and easy and good.  Loved the eggs as they came out cooked perfectly with no black ring and even though they were fresh from my girls, they peeled much more easily than normal cooking.  Will be trying out some other recipes as things settled down.  But I am happy with the size as I cook for just myself and can see it will keep me from cooking too much as I continue to struggle with cooking family sized meals and having too much food.  I just bought the 100 recipes for the Instapot mini and am looking forward to trying them out as they are perfect quantities.  I am also looking forward to making yogurt and soups.  I have used the old fashioned pressure cookers for 50 years.  I had a huge one I use for canning.  But this new style will be so easy to use and smaller than the other three pots I have.  I think it is a good purchase."},

My requirements were:. 1. Waterproofing without heat retention.. 2. Would the product be quiet on the bed?. 3. Proper fit on a deep mattress and topper.. 4. Ease of cleaning.. 5. A warranty of the product.. 6. Affordability.. I am happy to report that all of the above criteria were met.. As I suffer from hot flashes, I was seriously concerned that the product would be hot. It is not.. There is no discernable noise and the protector fits beautifully on the deep mattress.. I did pay attention to the washing recommendations by washing it on a cool cycle with my sheets and drying on gentle heat with the sheets, which kept it from bunching up and drying irregularly.. The terry top is soft, comfortable and keeps the sheet from sliding, which is very nice.. Also, I do appreciate the 10 year warranty, but hope I do not need it.. It would appear that some purchasers expected a mattress pad, although the description clearly states that it is a protector.. Lastly, I would recommend that high heat in washing and drying be avoided.. A very nice product at an excellent price!"},

For many years I have been afraid of pressure cookers after a very terrifying experience as a child when my Grandma had one explode on us while we were in the kitchen! I thought that if I bought this one, it would help me to get over my fear because this cooker works a bit differently. But, after it arrived and I read through the instructions, it sounds too complicated and scary for me to try it. I have been trying to get my nerve up to at least give it a try as I got it mostly to cook beans in. But it sounds like beans and pasta are not the best things to use in this cooker. If I can only get it packaged back in it's box, I will \"gift\" it to someone at my church  who is not afraid to use these things."},

I was skeptical at first, but I purchased one for myself over a year ago and love it, so I had to purchase another as a gift.

But the fact that you don't have to touch it is awesome. And making beans, chili, and hummus. Are simple and fast. I have never been able to make brown rice that wasn't gummy. The Insta pot made it perfectly. I have also made black rice and quinoa in it both have come out flawlessly. I would strongly suggest getting a cook book or finding some recipes online as well as reading the directions thoroughly. I had a mishap the first time I used it. I did not have the release valve in the proper position so I sprayed my entire counter top with the sticky oat liquid. Definitely user error that could have been avoided by reading the directions.. Overall I would highly recommend it."},

The IP gives me that freedom for almost everything I make. It is only 2 of us here at home, but I like to cook and freeze food & to make yogurt in a large container to place in the pot liner, I need room.  I would not have gotten the 6 quart... not at regular price.  I was told that there was a prime day sale that had the 6 quart flying off the shelves.  If I had known that then I would have gotten a 6 quart, but I know that I would not have been happy with that size.  I can always cook less in a big pot; in a smaller pot... you cannot cook more."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "WOW WOW!", "review_body": "I was actually searching for an electric pressure cooker, then came accross the multi cookers and decided it was a much better bet. After much comparisons with features and reviews I purchased my first electric multi-use cooker.  This appliance is just fantastic - and really replaces a rice cooker, pressure cooker, slow cooker and more in this all in one.  One my first use, cooking a pork roast, there was absolutely no noice from it and I thought maybe it wasn\u2019t working.  So I went online and researched, and found out the insta pot doesn\u2019t make any noice.  Quite a relief from those noisy hissing stove top pressure cookers.  My pork was done perfectly in about 30 mins- just set it and that was it.  I love the keep warm feature.  One thing is that this is really a big pressure cooker for just 3 persons.  I am seriously thinking of getting a smaller one - a 3 quart for every day use, since I will only be cooking large portions occasionally."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Simply the best out there!", "review_body": "After doing a ton of research on electric pressure cookers I decided to go with the Instant Pot and it's been nothing but pleasing and easy.  I know people say there's a 'learning curve' to these but I haven't experienced that.  I must admit, I'm not one to read manuals; I'd much rather watch the various videos out there.. A big part of my decision, especially in not buying the XL one from infomercials, was the warranty.  Buyer beware of the warranty on the XL-it's only 60 days and on top of that you have to pay $24.99 shipping if you have to return it in those 60 days.  A lot of people have reported this infomercial company is hard to get a hold of and that's not cool!  Another factor was I saw many reviews about the XL and people reported chipping and peeling of the interior - stainless never chips/peels and I would be concerned if the coating was coming off into my food, with stainless I feel much safer.. Getting back to the Instant Pot, I just received this on Friday and so far I've made the best Mac N Cheese, Chili, Beef Barley Soup, Baby Back Ribs and a creamed chicken recipe and they were all great.  I love the one-pot cooking, and easy clean-up.  If my stove/oven had a brain they might think they were retired!  One thing I need to mention is the size, the other one (XL) is 8qt and the Instant Pot is 6qt.  At first I was apprehensive about the 6qt size but I'm glad I went with the 6qt because I now think 8qt would have been too large.  Looking forward to so many more recipes and fun with this machine!"},

Then you just shred and eat :) it's also very easy to make soups and stews and a quick baked potato in 15 minutes too! I have not tried to yogurt making feature yet but I'm definitely looking forward to that.. It's also super easy to clean and the variety of different buttons makes it easy to cater the cooking as you need it"},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "Best Kitchen Addition", "review_body": "I love cooking, and as a double whammy so does my wife. This was purchased as a Christmas gift for her (and directly me as wells since I've been benefiting from all the deliciousness that emerges from the pot) and she absolutely loves it. 80% of all of our dinners are now cooked in our Insta Pot. It seems so daunting when you first pull it out of the box due to all of its features and buttons, but once you work through the manual its actually quite simple to use. I appreciate the weight and thickness of the stainless steel pot that goes inside. It's heavier than others I've looked at, and I also really like that its stainless and not non-stick. I have a friend who has another brand and his pot is non-stick. Both have very similar features and functions, however a lot of the recipes we've done make use of the saute feature prior to the pressure cook, and you just get a much better sear from the stainless pot. Plus, since the recipes all follow up with a pressure cook anyway, the natural science behind what happens inside prevents food from sticking to the pot anyway. Everything just wipes away with no effort. Some things to be aware of that I'm sure are probably mentioned in other reviews, the cook time in recipes does not account for the time it takes for the pot to come to pressure as well as release pressure (which is even longer if you wait for it to naturally depressurize), so that 4 minute mac and cheese can you do (which is the best darn stove top style mac and cheese you'll ever have btw) really takes closer to 20 minutes. Where you really see an impact in cooking time is when you cook items that normally would take hours. Rotisserie style chicken, pot roast, etc. all come out so tender and delicious in a fraction of the time they do if you cook it the traditional way. The only other thing I would be wary of is that I've noticed a lot of recipes we find for the cooker seem to lack a note to add salt (tons of recipes found online), especially most of the soup and stews we've found. I know its probably because salting to taste is the preference, but don't be afraid to salt your food before its cooked. And dessert? Holy cow, my wife made a cheesecake in the InstaPot that was amazing! Who knew right?  We couldn't be happier with this thing. Best investment in cooking we've made in a long time."},
{"rating": "5.0", "review_title": "The Perfect Electric Pressure Cooker!", "review_body": "If I could give this ten stars I would.......I've owned two other electric pressure cookers, that just didn't hold up.  This brand is almost indestructible.  The stem is recessed with a much thicker gauge of metal than my previous cookers.  The lid is fully removable along with the pressure release valve making it easier to clean any  spills or liquid that may have found their way through the vent. While the multiple buttons look intimidating, the process couldn't be easier with the excellent user manual. The stainless steel bowl is a breeze to clean. I've never had anything get stuck on the bottom that couldn't easily be scrubbed off.  The heat is evenly distributed and everything is cooked to perfection in a very short amount of time.
